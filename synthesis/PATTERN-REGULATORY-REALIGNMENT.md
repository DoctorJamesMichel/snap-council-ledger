## Summary

Across multiple domains, a consistent pattern appears:

Systems act before awareness explains.  
Regulation precedes choice.  
Physical laws remain fixed while available trajectories change.

This pattern does not describe interruption or command, but *realignment*—a shift in coupling conditions that alters which futures become accessible without violating underlying constraints.

---

## Observed Regularity

Across independent lines of inquiry:

- Neural activity predicts decisions before conscious awareness
- Physiological signals bias attention, mood, and action upstream of thought
- Systems transition between stable states through parameter tuning, not rule-breaking
- Physical laws remain invariant while outcomes differ based on configuration

Awareness arrives *after* initiation, functioning as a narrative integrator rather than a causal origin.

---

## Regulatory Interpretation

Under this pattern:

- Agency is not impulse
- Agency is not interruption
- Agency is not free deviation from law

Agency appears instead as **regulation**—the tuning of upstream conditions that shape downstream behavior.

Changes in sleep, safety, rhythm, attention, or coherence modify the system’s internal landscape.  
As alignment improves, different trajectories become viable.

Freedom manifests as *availability*, not exemption.

## Structural Implications

This pattern implies:

- Choice refines systems; it does not halt them
- Awareness modulates coupling, not causality
- Coherence reduces friction and stabilizes flow
- Disorder increases resistance and narrows paths

Narratives typically follow outcomes and claim authorship retroactively.

## Relationship to SNAP

Within the SNAP Council framework, this pattern is recorded as:

- A **sense-and-memory observation**
- A **completed consequence loop**
- A **cross-domain convergence**, not a doctrine

SNAP does not operationalize, enforce, or teach this pattern.  
It preserves the observation so future systems do not repeatedly rediscover it in isolation.

---

## Constraints

This artifact intentionally avoids:

- Enumerating techniques
- Naming thinking modes
- Issuing prescriptions
- Providing operational guidance

The pattern is documented without ownership, authority, or instructional intent.

---

## Provenance

This synthesis was assembled post-hoc from independently published observations across neuroscience, physiology, systems theory, and physics.

It records convergence, not authorship.  
No claim of originality or priority is made.
