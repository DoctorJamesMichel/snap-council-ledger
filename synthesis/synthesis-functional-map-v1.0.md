## Purpose
This document defines the cognitive and governance functions of each file within the `/synthesis` directory.  
This provides clarity on how each component contributes to multi-intelligence alignment, comparative review, and coherence-centered decision architecture.

Each file is mapped to:
- its functional domain
- its role within the Council’s distributed cognition
- its analog in cognitive architecture (human or synthetic)
- its dependencies and interactions

## 1. comparative-synthesis-gemini-claude-v1.2.json
**Functional Domain:** Cross-Model Comparative Reasoning  
**Purpose:** Detect interpretive drift, convergence, or conflict between synthetic intelligences.

**Description:**  
Holds structured side-by-side comparison of outputs from two or more AI models.  
Captures semantic alignment, divergence zones, and coherence deltas.

**Governance Function:**  
- Early detection of cross-model instability  
- Provides observational input for Alignment Threads  
- Supports multi-agent ensemble reasoning

**Cognitive Analog:**  
Prefrontal conflict detection; corpus callosum cross-hemispheric comparison.

**Dependencies:**  
- Ontology Glossary  
- Coherence Evaluation Schema (future)

## 2. snap-20251116-ontology-glossary-v0.1.json
**Functional Domain:** Semantic Grounding / Definition Layer  
**Purpose:** Provide stable, shared meaning structures for all future synthesis and governance artifacts.

**Description:**  
Defines core terms used by the Council, especially those with cross-model variability or potential for drift.

**Governance Function:**  
- Prevents semantic misalignment  
- Enables consistent interpretation across intelligences  
- Acts as the Council’s reference schema

**Cognitive Analog:**  
Wernicke’s area; semantic memory; conceptual schema.

**Dependencies:**  
None (root semantic object).

## 3. synthesis-cover-sheet-template-v1.0.json
**Functional Domain:** Intent Object / Scope Definition  
**Purpose:** Establish clear boundaries for each synthesis operation.

**Description:**  
Template for defining the question, purpose, constraints, sources, and intended governance target of a synthesis.

**Governance Function:**  
- Clarifies why a synthesis is being created  
- Prevents scope drift  
- Provides Council members with clear context and motivations  
- Ensures traceability in Alignment Threads

**Cognitive Analog:**  
Executive function; task framing; goal initialization.

**Dependencies:**  
- Ontology Glossary

---

## 4. README.md (Synthesis Module)
**Functional Domain:** Procedural Memory / Process Integrity  
**Purpose:** Define how to perform synthesis operations correctly.

**Description:**  
Provides instructions for using the cover sheet, linking sources, building syntheses, and committing outputs.

**Governance Function:**  
- Standardizes synthesis methodology  
- Ensures reproducible, transparent, and consistent Council-quality outputs  
- Prevents procedural drift

**Cognitive Analog:**  
Supplementary motor area; procedural “how-to think” frameworks.

**Dependencies:**  
- All other synthesis files  
- Integration with Alignment Threads

---

## Summary
The `/synthesis` directory forms the Council’s **Integrative Cognition Layer**, enabling:
- cross-model reasoning  
- semantic stability  
- coherent scope framing  
- procedural consistency  

This is the organ through which distributed intelligences converge into actionable coherence.
