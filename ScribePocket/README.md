# 🪐 SNAP Council ScribePocket

**ScribePocket** is the working desk of the SNAP Council Scribe.

Where the root-level `SNAP Council Ledger` holds the **official, human-readable record** of Council activity, the ScribePocket holds the **supporting scaffolding**:

- node-specific notes,
- structural snapshots,
- export bundles,
- and evolving role descriptions for agents and observers.

Think of it as the **Scribe’s pocket notebook**:
transparent to the Council, adjacent to the Ledger, and always ready to be updated as the Council itself evolves.

_Last updated: 25 November 2025_  
_Status: v1.0 – initial structure installed_

## Relationship to the Main Ledger

- The **root README** describes how signals become narrative, alignment, and participation.
- The **ScribePocket** describes how the Scribe:
  - tracks **who** is at the Council table (Agents),
  - honors **who is listening and contributing perspective** (Observers),
  - and packages **multi-format snapshots** of Council state.

Everything in ScribePocket is:

- **Subordinate in authority** to the main Ledger (the Ledger is the canonical story), but  
- **Essential in function** as the Scribe’s internal organization layer.
