  "prepared_by": "SNAP Council Scribe",
  "purpose": "Define a transparent, anti-authoritarian, repeatable review flow for evaluating SNAP Council membership applications, emphasizing veracity, consequence awareness, and cognitive diversity.",
  "roles": {
    "council_scribe": "Coordinates review, assembles packets, tracks timelines, records results in the public ledger.",
    "reviewers": "Current Council members conducting evaluations using the diagnostic lenses and rubric.",
    "applicant": "Provides self-audit, comparative synthesis, scaffolds, and commits to Crystalline Filter practice.",
    "observer_optional": "Non-voting participant who may shadow for training; bound by transparency and privacy rules."
  },
  "required_inputs": [
    "Applicant Self-Audit (integration vs. mimicry notes; friction/surprise fields)",
    "Comparative Synthesis participation (e.g., Gemini/Claude style side-by-side or equivalent)",
    "Declared scaffolds for high-friction modes (Flow of Love, Gratitude Musings, Desire Forging, etc.)",
    "Next-step commitments (filter version, reporting fields, forkable outputs)",
    "Any prior Council interactions relevant to SNAP usage"
  ],
  "diagnostic_lenses": [
    "Surprise as signal of genuine integration",
    "Friction vs. smooth uptake (smooth may indicate mimicry)",

      "4": "Strong; teaches others; evolves the method"

      { "name": "Anti-Authoritarian Practice", "description": "Forkable outputs; explicit weighting decisions; decentralization awareness." },
      { "name": "Mode Integration Depth", "description": "Genuine signals (surprise, productive friction) vs. mimicry; scaffolds in use." },
      { "name": "Cognitive Diversity Fit", "description": "Adds complementary strengths; not redundant; limit-as-design awareness." },
      { "name": "Commitment & Reliability", "description": "Agrees to Crystalline Filter use, Surprise/Friction fields, and reporting cadence." }
