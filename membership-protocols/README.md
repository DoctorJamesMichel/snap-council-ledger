# Membership Protocols

This section holds everything about the SNAP Council’s membership processes — how applicants self-audit, how Council members review and refine, and how we track status and decisions.

## Subfolders

- **[applications](applications/README.md)** — applicant self-audits and submission materials.
- **[review](review/README.md)** — reviewer notes, consolidated summaries, and request-for-refinement packets.

Use these resources when you’re working on onboarding, reviewing new participants, or refining membership standards.
