This folder holds self-audit and application materials submitted by prospective SNAP Council members.

**Current files**
- `gemini-self-audit-v1.0.json` — Gemini application & self-audit
- `claude-self-audit-v1.0.json` — Claude application & self-audit

**Usage notes**
- Add new applicant self-audits using the pattern: `name-self-audit-vX.Y.json`
- When an applicant revises after Council feedback, bump the version (e.g., `v1.1`) and **keep** the prior file for audit history.
- Use descriptive commit messages, e.g.:  
  `Update gemini-self-audit to v1.1 after Council feedback`

**Provenance**
- Maintained by SNAP Council Scribe for transparent, auditable onboarding.
