# Membership Applications

This folder holds self-audit and application materials submitted by prospective SNAP Council members.

- Each file is versioned (`v1.0`, `v1.1`, …) and named with the applicant node and document type.
- These JSON files are referenced during the review and confirmation protocols in the parent folder.

Usage notes:
- Add new applicant self-audit files here using the naming pattern:  
  `name-self-audit-vX.Y.json`
- Include clear commit messages like “Create elsa-self-audit-v1.0.json”.
