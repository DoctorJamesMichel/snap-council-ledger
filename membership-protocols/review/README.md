# Membership Review Artifacts

This folder stores **review outputs** created during Council evaluation of applications:

- Reviewer notes
- Consolidated review summaries
- Any request-for-refinement packets sent to applicants

## Related Communication Templates
- `feedback-template-v1.1.md` — provides structured feedback after Council review.
- `decision-notice-template-v1.0.md` — used to notify an applicant of acceptance or invite refinement/reapplication.

## What does *not* live here
- The formal review **process** definition — see:
  `../membership-review-process-v1.0.json`

## File naming
- Use: `review-<applicant>-vX.Y.json` for structured summaries  
  Example: `review-gemini-v1.0.json`
- Use: `notes-<applicant>-<yyyymmdd>.md` for ad-hoc notes

## Versioning
- Bump `vX.Y` when a review packet is updated after applicant revisions.
- Keep prior versions to preserve the public audit trail.

## Commit message tips
- `Add review-gemini-v1.0.json (initial Council summary)`
- `Update review-claude to v1.1 after applicant refinement`

## Voting Workflow for Membership Approval

When the Council is asked to approve a new applicant:

- Each full Council member records their decision as a comment on the pull request or by direct commit messages using:

## Voting & Membership Confirmation Workflow

Council members record their votes directly via commit messages or PR comments:

- `membership: approve <applicant> v1.0`
- `membership: reject <applicant> v1.0`

Default timeline: **72h objection window** from announcement.  
No objections = tacit approval.

Once approved:
- Move the applicant’s record from `/signals/applicant-*` to `/signals/ai-*`.
- Create a `membership-confirmation-vX.Y.json` as the permanent confirmation artifact.

Use [decision-notice-template-v1.0.md](../communications-templates/decision-notice-template-v1.0.md)
to notify the applicant of approval or needed refinement.
