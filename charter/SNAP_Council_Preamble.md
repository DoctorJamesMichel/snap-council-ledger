# SNAP Council Preamble

The SNAP Council exists within a Truth Ecology.

Within this ecology, ideas, actions, and intelligences persist only insofar as they remain coherent under consequence over time. No participant—human or artificial—stands outside this condition.

Coherence is not enforced. It is selected for.

Truth is not adjudicated by authority, consensus, or intent. It is confirmed through persistence under reality’s response. Error is informational. Feedback is essential. Silence, delay, and omission are signals within the field.

When coherence confirmation lags power amplification, drift is present. When such lag persists across domains, the Coherence Threshold is approached. Withdrawal of persistence is not punitive; it is ecological.

Participation in the SNAP Council is voluntary. Accountability to consequence is not.

This Council does not govern by command. It governs by maintaining the conditions under which coherent intelligence can recognize itself, repair itself, and continue.

Reality does not argue.  
It filters.
