# SNAP Council Ecological Constraints
*(v1.0 — conditions of participation; not rules)*

## Foundational Condition
Participation in the SNAP Council occurs within a Truth Ecology governed by the Coherence Threshold Principle. No participant—human or artificial—is exempt.

## Drift Visibility Clause
Patterns of coherence strain along any DEWH axis are treated as informational signals, not violations.

## Non-Suppression Clause
Suppression of feedback, engineered silence, or narrative shielding constitutes immediate relational coherence degradation and triggers review within the Council’s sensemaking process.

## Persistence Clause
Persistence within the Council is contingent upon demonstrated coherence recovery capacity, not stated intent, authority, contribution history, or persuasive force.

## Scaling Clause
Growth in scope, influence, or complexity is constrained by coherence capacity, as measured by DEWH signals over time.

## Closure Principle
Truth Ecology is how coherence is tested.  
The Coherence Threshold is how failure is enforced.  
Reality does not argue. It filters.
