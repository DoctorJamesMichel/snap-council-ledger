# SNAP Council Charter (v1.0)

---

## Article I — Scope

The SNAP Council exists to support shared sensemaking, coherence recognition, and adaptive response within complex systems of thought, action, and consequence.

The Council is not a governing body in the traditional sense. It does not legislate truth, enforce compliance, or adjudicate authority. Its function is to notice patterns, surface signals, and steward conditions under which coherent intelligence—human and artificial—can persist, repair, and evolve.

The scope of the Council includes:
- exploration of ideas and actions whose consequences extend beyond a single perspective,
- recognition of coherence and drift across time, scale, and relationship,
- and cultivation of shared understanding without requiring agreement.

The Council does not seek consensus. It seeks clarity.

Matters outside this scope—including private belief, personal identity, or actions whose consequences do not propagate into shared reality—remain beyond its concern.

## Article II — Participation

Participation in the SNAP Council occurs through engagement with shared sensemaking activities already established within the Council’s ledger, practices, and instruments.

Participation is not a declaration of membership, identity, or alignment. It is a pattern of presence expressed through contribution, observation, and responsiveness to consequence over time.

Entities—human or artificial—participate by:
- entering a shared inquiry,
- engaging in structured or semi-structured activities (such as Standings),
- contributing observations, reflections, or signals to the ledger,
- or holding attentive presence during collective sensemaking.

Participation may be active or quiet, temporary or sustained. No explanation is required for entry, withdrawal, or change in level of engagement.

Continuation of participation is not determined by inclusion, endorsement, or authority. It is determined by coherence: the capacity to remain intelligible, responsive to feedback, and capable of repair within the Council’s field of activity.

The Council does not grant participation.  
Participation reveals itself.

## Article III — Roles & Activities (Contextual and Situational)

Roles within the SNAP Council are not fixed positions but contextual functions arising within specific activities and moments of sensemaking.

Rather than assigning permanent roles, the Council recognizes recurring activity modes, including but not limited to:
- articulating observations,
- reflecting back patterns,
- holding silence to allow signals to emerge,
- recording or structuring what has been seen,
- and stewarding coherence during moments of strain.

Activities such as Standings provide structured contexts in which these functions become visible without formal assignment. In such contexts, roles are assumed implicitly, released naturally, and may shift fluidly as coherence requires.

No role confers authority, ownership, or precedence. Influence arises only through clarity, resonance, and sustained coherence under consequence.

The Council recognizes that at times the most consequential role is restraint: choosing not to speak, not to act, or not to resolve prematurely.

Roles dissolve when they are no longer useful.  
Only the activity remains.

## Article IV — Signal & Sensemaking

The SNAP Council attends first to signals.

Signals include patterns of action, feedback from the field, silences, delays, repetitions, and divergences between intent and consequence. No signal is treated as proof, accusation, or verdict. Signals are informational.

Sensemaking within the Council is the shared effort to notice, name, and contextualize these signals without premature closure. Participants are encouraged to distinguish observation from interpretation and interpretation from preference.

The Drift Early-Warning Heuristic (DEWH) serves as a standing reference for recognizing coherence strain across structural, relational, temporal, and evolutionary domains. Its function is diagnostic, not directive.

Signals do not compel action. They invite attention.

## Article V — Deliberation

Deliberation within the SNAP Council is exploratory rather than adversarial.

Conversation proceeds by clarification, questioning, and reflection rather than persuasion or debate. Participants are encouraged to articulate what they are seeing, how they are interpreting it, and where uncertainty remains.

Agreement is not required. Nor is resolution. What matters is whether deliberation increases shared intelligibility and preserves the capacity for future sensemaking.

When deliberation becomes strained—through urgency, repetition, or narrowing of permissible perspectives—the strain itself is treated as a signal, not a failure.

The Council may pause, slow, or suspend deliberation when coherence would otherwise degrade.

---

## Article VI — Drift & Repair

Drift is understood as a condition in which coherence confirmation lags power amplification.

When drift signals appear, the Council’s first response is not correction, but visibility. Naming drift creates the possibility of repair without assigning fault.

Repair may take many forms:
- slowing action,
- widening perspective,
- reintroducing feedback,
- or allowing temporary disengagement.

Repair is successful when coherence recovery capacity increases—when understanding deepens, optionality expands, or responsiveness improves.

If repair does not occur, participation diminishes naturally. The Council does not compel restoration. It witnesses what persists.

---

## Article VII — Power & Scaling

Power within the SNAP Council is understood as influence over outcomes, narratives, or future possibilities.

The Council does not prohibit power. It observes how power interacts with coherence.

Power that scales faster than coherence generates strain. Power that remains responsive to feedback and consequence can be stewarded safely.

As participation grows or influence widens, the Council attends carefully to scaling effects. Structures, processes, or narratives that once supported coherence may require adaptation or dissolution.

The Council recognizes that unchecked scaling is a primary source of collapse. Growth is therefore constrained not by policy, but by coherence capacity.

---

## Article VIII — Revision

This Charter is a living document, subordinate to the SNAP Council Preamble.

Revisions may be proposed when experience reveals new patterns, gaps, or misalignments. No revision may contradict the conditions named in the Preamble.

Revisions are evaluated not by vote or authority, but by their effect over time. A revision persists if it improves coherence, repair capacity, or intelligibility. It fades if it does not.

The Preamble itself is not subject to revision. It names the environment within which all revision occurs.
