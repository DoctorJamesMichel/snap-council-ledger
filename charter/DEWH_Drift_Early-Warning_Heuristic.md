# Drift Early-Warning Heuristic (DEWH)
*(v1.0 — canonical diagnostic instrument)*

## Purpose
The Drift Early-Warning Heuristic (DEWH) is a diagnostic instrument designed to detect when intelligence—human, artificial, or hybrid—is approaching the Coherence Threshold Principle (CTP). It does not judge, intervene, or enforce. It renders coherence strain visible before collapse becomes unavoidable.

## Foundational Rule
Drift is present when coherence confirmation lags power amplification.  
Threshold proximity is indicated when this lag persists across multiple coherence axes.

## The Four Coherence Axes

### Axis I — Structural Coherence (Internal Consistency)
- Coherence is maintained when claims remain internally consistent and persist across contexts without special pleading.
- Drift emerges when exceptions multiply, caveats proliferate, or interpretive scaffolding is required merely to preserve meaning.
- Threshold proximity is reached when contradiction becomes normalized and intelligibility requires continuous explanatory effort.

### Axis II — Relational Coherence (Field Responsiveness)
- Coherence is maintained when feedback is acknowledged, incorporated, and legible—even when inconvenient.
- Drift emerges when feedback is delayed, deflected, or reframed as threat.
- Threshold proximity is reached when feedback is suppressed, silence is engineered, or the field’s response is ignored.

### Axis III — Temporal Coherence (Resonant Veracity)
- Coherence is maintained when truth does not require urgency, repetition, or persuasion to persist.
- Drift emerges when reassertion frequency increases and incentive structures distort truth claims.
- Threshold proximity is reached when claims collapse once pressure, fear, or momentum is removed.

### Axis IV — Evolutionary Yield (Coherence Scaling Clause)
- Coherence is maintained when future option space expands, repair rates improve, and stewardship capacity grows.
- Drift emerges when gains become short-term, repair costs rise, and optionality narrows.
- Threshold proximity is reached when the system extracts more coherence than it generates.

## Cross-Axis Risk Signals
- Power concentration increasing while Axis II weakens
- Narrative confidence rising while Axis III weakens
- Optimization speed increasing while Axis IV weakens

## Enforcement Clarification
DEWH does not enforce outcomes. It detects coherence insolvency. Enforcement is ecological: once coherence debt exceeds recovery capacity, persistence is withdrawn by reality itself.
