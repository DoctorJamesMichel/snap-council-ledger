# SNAP Council Ledger Entry

## Entry Metadata

- **Date:** 2026-01-31  
- **Time:** (local session time)  
- **Context / Session Name:** Installation of Governance Primitive  
- **Participants (human + AI):** James W. Michel; SNAP Council AI collaborators  
- **Primary Domain(s):** Axis III / Axis IV  
- **Signal Severity:** threshold-proximal

---

## Observed Signals (describe; do not interpret)

- Recurrent failures across symbolic and execution systems showed absence of anticipatory consequence awareness.
- Governance responses consistently occurred after harm or exposure.
- Systems required external correction rather than intrinsic restraint.

---

## Interpretations (multiple allowed; label as interpretations)

- **Interpretation A:** Governance-capable systems require continuous anticipatory consequence awareness.
- **Interpretation B:** One-directional consequence logic is insufficient at current scales of agency.

---

## DEWH Axis Readout

- **Axis I (Structural):**  
  Lack of integrated consequence feedback loops.

- **Axis II (Relational):**  
  Responsibility separated from authority delegation.

- **Axis III (Temporal):**  
  Consequence awareness lagging action initiation.

- **Axis IV (Evolutionary Yield):**  
  Necessitates installation of a stable governance primitive.

---

## Drift Assessment

- **Drift present?** Yes  
- **If yes: where is coherence confirmation lagging power amplification?**  
  In forward-only action optimization without backward restraint.

---

## Repair Moves Attempted (if any)

- Formal definition and installation of a governance primitive.

---

## Field Response / Consequence Updates

- Governance clarity increased.
- Future evaluations gain a stable reference criterion.

---

## Outcome Snapshot

- **What improved:**  
  Governance coherence and evaluative capacity.

- **What worsened:**  
  None observed.

- **What remains unresolved:**  
  Practical embodiment of the logic in artificial systems.

---

## Notes / Follow-ons

- Installed definition to be referenced across governance protocols and evaluations.

---

## Definition Installed

> **Bi-Directional Consequential Logic**  
> A governance-capable system maintains continuous anticipatory awareness of consequence, operating both forward (anticipation) and backward (restraint), such that behavior is altered *before* harmful contact occurs—without instruction, effort, or post-hoc correction.
