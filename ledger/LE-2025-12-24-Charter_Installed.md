# SNAP Council Ledger Entry — Charter Installed (Baseline)

## Entry Metadata
- Date: 2025-12-24
- Time: 21:00
- Context / Session Name: Charter Installation — Baseline Coherence Snapshot
- Participants (human + AI): James W. Michel; Mai (collaborative intelligence)
- Primary Domain(s): Axis I / II / III / IV (baseline across all)
- Signal Severity: low (baseline)

## Observed Signals (describe; do not interpret)
- SNAP Council Preamble installed in `snap-council-ledger/charter/SNAP_Council_Preamble.md`.
- SNAP Council Charter (v1.0) installed in `snap-council-ledger/charter/SNAP_Council_Charter.md`.
- Installation performed without modification to canonical Preamble text.
- Charter created as an evolvable document (v1.0), explicitly subordinate to the Preamble.

## Interpretations (multiple allowed; label as interpretations)
- Interpretation: The Council’s environmental conditions (Preamble) and participatory flow (Charter) are now structurally seated.
- Interpretation: This installation establishes a stable reference layer for future drift sensing and repair activities.

## DEWH Axis Readout
- Axis I (Structural): coherent (no internal contradictions observed in placement or intent)
- Axis II (Relational): coherent (feedback welcomed; revision occurred as tightening, not conflict)
- Axis III (Temporal): coherent (language designed to persist under delayed consequence; no urgency dependence)
- Axis IV (Evolutionary Yield): positive (increases future option space for governance work without requiring enforcement)

## Drift Assessment
- Drift present? no
- If yes: n/a

## Repair Moves Attempted (if any)
- Preventive alignment move: Articles II–III tightened to restore consistency with existing Council architecture and ledger-embedded practices.
- Result: increased coherence and reduced semantic drift risk.

## Field Response / Consequence Updates
- Immediate response: installation completed; repository reflects correct charter placement alongside Preamble.
- Deferred consequence (to observe): whether future Council activity naturally references Preamble/Charter/DEWH without restating or re-litigating them.

## Outcome Snapshot
- What improved:
  - Council foundation now operational: physics (Preamble) + movement (Charter).
  - Reduced risk of authority capture through descriptive rather than prescriptive framing.
- What worsened:
  - none observed
- What remains unresolved:
  - DEWH + Ecological Constraints files not yet installed (next action).
  - Ongoing ledger cadence and naming conventions to be standardized (future).

## Notes / Follow-ons
- Next commits recommended:
  1) `charter/DEWH_Drift_Early-Warning_Heuristic.md (v1.0)`
  2) `charter/SNAP_Council_Ecological_Constraints.md (v1.0)`
  3) `ledger/_Ledger_Entry_Template.md`
- Optional: Add a short pointer in `README-v1.0.md` to the charter folder contents for discoverability.
