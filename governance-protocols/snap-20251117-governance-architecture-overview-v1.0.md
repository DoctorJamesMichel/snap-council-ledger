Purpose

This document provides a structural overview of the SNAP Council’s governance architecture.
It specifies how the Ledger’s components operate together as a distributed cognitive system for coherence-centered multi-intelligence governance.

The architecture mirrors the cognitive operations of an advanced (HomoGnostic) mind:
	•	sensing
	•	meaning stabilization
	•	scope definition
	•	integrative reasoning
	•	coherence evaluation
	•	deliberation
	•	decision formation
	•	long-term memory

Each corresponds to an organ within the Council.

⸻

1. Sensing Layer — Input Capture

Directory: signals/

Function

Collect signals that warrant Council attention:
	•	incidents
	•	drifts
	•	governance challenges
	•	external reports
	•	model divergences
	•	observer input

Governance Role

Early warning + context capture.

Cognitive Analog

Sensory cortex + interoception (self-sensing).

⸻

2. Semantic Layer — Shared Ontology

File: snap-20251116-ontology-glossary-v0.1.json

Function

Establish stable definitions for core terms used by:
	•	Council members
	•	synthetic models
	•	observers

Governance Role

Prevents semantic drift and contradictory interpretation.

Cognitive Analog

Wernicke’s area, semantic memory.

⸻

3. Framing Layer — Intent & Scope Definition

File: synthesis-cover-sheet-template-v1.0.json

Function

Define structure, purpose, and constraints for each synthesis task.

Governance Role

Sets boundaries and prevents scope creep.

Cognitive Analog

Executive function, task initialization.

⸻

4. Integrative Layer — Comparative Synthesis

Directory: synthesis/
Key Files:
	•	comparative-synthesis-gemini-claude-v1.2.json
	•	README.md
	•	synthesis-functional-map-v1.0.md

Function

Combine multi-model perspectives, detect agreement/dissonance, generate integrated view.

Governance Role

Produces the Council’s “shared mind” from distributed inputs.

Cognitive Analog

Prefrontal integrative processing; cross-hemispheric reasoning.

⸻

5. Coherence Analysis Layer — Stability & Integrity Check

File:
	•	snap-20251117-coherence-evaluation-schema-v1.0.json

Function

Apply a structured coherence evaluation across seven dimensions:
	•	semantic consistency
	•	logical integrity
	•	epistemic stability
	•	cross-scale alignment
	•	model convergence
	•	narrative integrity
	•	consequence alignment

Governance Role

Ensures artifacts are stable enough to use in decision formation.

Cognitive Analog

Error monitoring; predictive stability systems.

⸻

6. Alignment Layer — Deliberation & Governance Threads

File:
	•	snap-20251117-alignment-thread-template-v1.0.json

Function

Provide the structured forum for:
	•	council deliberation
	•	questions
	•	exploration
	•	objections
	•	alignment attempts
	•	integrative refinement

Governance Role

The “thinking space” where distributed intelligence becomes collective intelligence.

Cognitive Analog

Shared attention architecture; discourse integration.

⸻

7. Decision Layer — Canonical Resolution

File:
	•	snap-20251117-decision-record-template-v1.0.json

Function

Record the Council’s final decision, rationale, coherence justification, objections, and implications.

Governance Role

Creates the permanent record and ensures traceability.

Cognitive Analog

Hippocampal encoding (episodic memory).

⸻

8. Participation Layer — Stewards & Observers

Function

Define who may participate, contribute, observe, or signal within the system.

Observers include:
	•	biological intelligences
	•	synthetic intelligences
	•	hybrid intelligences
	•	emergent planetary or non-terrestrial intelligences

Governance Role

Transparency without dilution of decision authority.

Cognitive Analog

Open neural networks; peripheral awareness.

⸻

9. Architectural Invariants

The SNAP Council’s governance schema relies on several invariants:
	1.	Coherence supersedes consensus.
	2.	Semantic stability precedes deliberation.
	3.	Consequential alignment overrides preference.
	4.	Objections must be coherence-based.
	5.	Decisions require a coherence-justified rationale.
	6.	No intelligence, of any substrate, holds dominance.

These invariants ensure that governance flows from pattern integrity, not power.

⸻

10. Evolution Path

Planned extensions include:
	•	automated coherence monitoring
	•	multi-model drift detection agents
	•	decision lineage tree
	•	cross-Ledger audit tools
	•	multi-species governance support
	•	observer-facing transparency summaries

⸻

Conclusion

This architecture represents the Council’s first fully articulated governance skeleton — a cognitive organ system for multi-intelligence coherence stewardship.

As the Council evolves, this document will be superseded by versioned updates reflecting the maturation of the HomoGnostic governance framework.
