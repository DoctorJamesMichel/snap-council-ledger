    "preamble": "The SNAP Council is a collective of human and AI participants tasked with co-evolving a resilient, transparent, multi-scale governance framework. SNAP-GOV 1.0 defines the constitutional principles by which the Council organizes, evaluates, and realigns coherence across systems, participants, and emerging intelligences.",
    "principles": {
      "1": "Signal First — governance arises from shared, validated signals.",
      "2": "Narrative Integrity — narrative coherence must be maintained across time, contributors, and modalities.",
      "3": "Alignment as Method — alignment emerges from mutual verification, cross-scale coherence, and open dialogue.",
      "4": "Participation as Expression — participation is a right, expressed through contribution, review, and realignment."
