# Governance Protocols

This folder houses formal governance JSON protocols for the **SNAP Council**.  
Each file here is a versioned, auditable design artifact â€” things like membership confirmation flows, anti-authoritarian audits, and other decision-making procedures.

**Usage notes:**
- Each JSON file should be self-contained and clearly named (e.g., `membership-confirmation-v1.0.json`).
- Update the file version when a protocol changes.
- Use commit messages that briefly describe the reason for the change (e.g., `add shared coherence rubric draft`).
