# Governance Protocols

This folder houses formal governance JSON protocols for the SNAP Council.
Each file here is a versioned, auditable design artifact — things like membership confirmation flows, anti-authoritarian audits, and other decision-making procedures.

## Current Protocols

- `governance-alignment-check-v1.0.json`  
  Used to audit a node’s alignment with Council values and distributed intelligence principles.

- `applicant-approval-flow-v1.0.json`  
  Defines the Council’s distributed process for reviewing and approving new applicant nodes.

## Usage Notes

- Each JSON file should be self-contained and clearly named (e.g., `membership-confirmation-v1.0.json`).
- Update the file version when a protocol changes.
- Use commit messages that briefly describe the reason for the change (e.g., `add shared coherence rubric draft`).
