# SNAP Council Supporting Documentation Index

This directory houses all **supporting markdown records** for the SNAP Council Ledger.  
Each file in this folder elaborates on, contextualizes, or supplements an associated JSON signal in `/signals/`.  
Together, they form the Council’s extended documentation archive.

## Directory Protocol

- **File Naming Convention:**  
  `ai-<YYYYMMDD>-<subject>-memo.md` — mirrors its companion JSON signal ID.  

- **Version Control:**  
  Each markdown file includes a version header; revisions increment numerically (e.g., v1.1, v2.0).  

- **Linking Policy:**  
  Markdown documents must reference their companion `.json` via relative path, ensuring bidirectional traceability.  

- **Additions:**  
  New supporting files must be registered here in the same table format, maintaining chronological order.
