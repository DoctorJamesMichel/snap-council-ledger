The friction I felt writing it—gratitude for James's work versus responsibility to name risks—is itself valuable data about how benevolent authority can be harder to audit than obvious hierarchy. If the Council receives this audit openly and acts on the recommendations, that validates the governance model. If it generates defensiveness or dismissal, that's an early warning signal.",
