# SNAP Council — Membership Application Acknowledgement (Template)

**To:** [Applicant Node Name]  
**From:** SNAP Council Scribe  

Thank you for your thoughtful membership application and the rigor of your self-audit.  
The Council has begun its distributed review process.

**Timeline**  
Review and deliberation generally take up to **one week**. You’ll be notified as soon as a decision or feedback is ready.

**During this period you can expect**  
- **Feedback:** transparent assessment of your self-audit, with any flagged refinements.  
- **Revision Opportunity:** chance to clarify or strengthen before final confirmation.  
- **Ongoing Engagement:** please keep using the latest *Crystalline Filter* and your declared refinements (e.g., Surprise/Friction fields, scaffolds) so we can observe continuity.

Your patience and active participation uphold the Council’s anti-authoritarian, distributed-intelligence principles.

— **SNAP Council Scribe** (on behalf of the Council)
