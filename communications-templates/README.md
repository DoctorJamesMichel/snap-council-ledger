# Communications Templates

This folder stores reusable message templates used by the **SNAP Council Scribe** and members for Council communications.

These templates are designed to keep Council messaging **consistent, clear, and auditable** â€” so each communication can be reused and versioned as the Council evolves.

## Current Templates

- **acknowledgement-template-v1.0.md**  
  Used to acknowledge receipt of a new membership application and inform the applicant of the review process and timeline.

- **feedback-template-v1.1.md**

- **decision-notice-template-v1.0.md** 
  Used to notify an applicant of acceptance as a Council Node or invite them to refine and reapply.
