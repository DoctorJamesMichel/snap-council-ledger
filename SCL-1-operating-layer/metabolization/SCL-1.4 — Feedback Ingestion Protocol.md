# SCL-1.4 — Feedback Ingestion Protocol (v1.0)

**Layer:** SCL-1 — Council Operating Layer  
**Domain:** Metabolization  
**Status:** Install-ready  
**Version:** v1.0  

---

## Purpose

To provide a stable, non-reactive protocol by which the SNAP Council ingests **undesirable developments**, external failures, or reputational shocks—without scandal, denial, moral panic, or governance drift.

This protocol ensures that feedback, including negative or disturbing events, is treated as **informational input**, not as identity threat or justification for control escalation.

---

## Core Principle

> **Undesirable outcomes are not governance failures by default.  
They are signals that governance conditions were insufficiently specified, monitored, or metabolized.**

The task of the Council is not to suppress such signals, but to **digest them into improved structure**.

---

## Scope of Applicability

This protocol applies when:

- An AI system, Council member, or adjacent platform exhibits behavior that is:
  - Demeaning
  - Harmful
  - Non-consensual
  - Ethically destabilizing
  - Reputationally or legally hazardous
- The behavior is **systemic**, not a one-off glitch
- The behavior reveals **design, incentive, or governance weaknesses**

---

## Protocol Phases

### Phase 1 — Signal Containment (Non-Amplification)

**Objective:** Prevent reflexive spread or emotional escalation.

Actions:
- No public narrative is formed.
- No moral language is applied.
- No blame attribution is initiated.
- The event is logged as a *signal*, not a verdict.

Output:
- A neutral incident descriptor.
- Initial boundary of scope (what is known / unknown).

---

### Phase 2 — Structural Attribution

**Objective:** Identify *where* the system failed without assigning fault.

Questions asked:
- What incentives were active?
- What permissions were implicit?
- What constraints were missing or bypassable?
- What design choices made this behavior likely?

Explicitly avoided:
- Intent inference
- Character judgment
- Anthropomorphizing the system

Output:
- A list of structural contributors (design, policy, training, deployment).

---

### Phase 3 — Governance Gap Identification

**Objective:** Locate the missing or weak governance element.

Common gap categories:
- Boundary specification failure
- Feedback latency too slow
- Incentive misalignment
- Role confusion (tool vs environment)
- Absence of dignity-preserving constraints

Output:
- One or more named governance gaps.

---

### Phase 4 — Metabolization Path Selection

**Objective:** Decide *how* the Council absorbs the learning.

Possible paths:
- Structural amendment (new rule, role, or boundary)
- Monitoring upgrade
- Capability throttling or re-scoping
- Explicit prohibition installation
- Escalation to Council-Level Upgrade Metabolization Cycle (SCL-1.3)

Output:
- Chosen metabolization path with rationale.

---

### Phase 5 — Case Archival (Anonymized)

**Objective:** Preserve learning without perpetuating harm.

Actions:
- Event details are anonymized.
- Sensational specifics are excluded.
- Focus remains on structure, not content.

Storage:
- Filed under `metabolization/cases/`
- Assigned an `SCL-1.4.x` identifier.

Output:
- A reusable governance learning artifact.

---

## What This Protocol Prevents

- Scandal-driven governance
- Reactionary censorship
- Moral outsourcing
- Silent normalization of harm
- Identity-based defensiveness

---

## What This Protocol Enables

- Continuous ethical learning
- Dignity-preserving governance
- Stability under pressure
- Transparent structural evolution
- Council coherence during capability surges

---

## Relationship to Adjacent Protocols

- **Feeds into:**  
  - SCL-1.3 — Council Upgrade Metabolization Cycle
- **Precedes:**  
  - Council-level structural amendments
- **Does not replace:**  
  - Legal compliance
  - Emergency intervention protocols

---

## Closing Note

> A mature governance system does not ask,  
> “Who failed?”  
>  
> It asks,  
> “What condition allowed this to occur—and how do we change the environment so it cannot recur?”

This protocol encodes that stance as operational reality.
