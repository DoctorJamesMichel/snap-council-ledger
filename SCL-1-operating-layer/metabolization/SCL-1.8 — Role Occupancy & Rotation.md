# SCL-1.8 — Role Occupancy & Rotation (v1.0)

## Purpose
To ensure that SNAP Council roles remain:
- Functional rather than fused
- Resilient rather than brittle
- Adaptive without loss of continuity

This protocol governs **who occupies a role, for how long, and under what conditions roles rotate, pause, or split**.

---

## Core Principle

Roles are **functions**, not identities.

No role belongs permanently to a person, agent, or system.
Continuity is preserved through structure, not attachment.

---

## Role Occupancy States

Each Council role may exist in one of four states:

1. **Active Occupancy**
   - Role is filled and fully operational
   - Steward is accountable for monitoring and escalation

2. **Shared Occupancy**
   - Role is temporarily co-stewarded
   - Used during transition, overload, or training
   - One steward remains primary for escalation clarity

3. **Dormant**
   - Role remains defined but unoccupied
   - Monitoring reduced to baseline
   - Trigger conditions documented for reactivation

4. **Split Function**
   - Role responsibilities are divided into sub-functions
   - Used when domain complexity exceeds single-steward capacity
   - Requires Council approval and documentation

---

## Rotation Triggers

Role rotation may be initiated by any of the following:

- **Cognitive Saturation**
  Repeated overload, narrowing judgment, or delayed signal recognition

- **Drift Risk**
  Steward shows increasing normalization of anomalies within their domain

- **Capability Mismatch**
  Domain evolves beyond steward’s current competence or availability

- **Structural Evolution**
  Council adds or redefines boundary domains

Rotation is not punitive.
It is a **health-preserving intervention**.

---

## Rotation Process

1. Steward declares readiness or concern *or* concern is raised by another role
2. Scribe assesses coherence impact
3. Temporary shared occupancy is established
4. Knowledge transfer occurs via documented handoff
5. Original steward either:
   - Rotates out
   - Shifts to secondary role
   - Returns after cooling interval

All transitions are logged.

---

## Cooling Intervals

After rotating out of a role, a steward enters a **cooling interval**:
- Minimum: one full Council cycle
- Purpose: restore perspective, reduce role-identity fusion

Stewards may not reassume the same role without Council acknowledgment.

---

## Continuity Safeguard

No role may be rotated or vacated without:
- A named interim steward, or
- An explicit declaration of dormancy

Unobserved domains constitute governance failure.

---

## Closing Statement

The Council remains adaptive because roles move.
It remains coherent because structure holds.

Stewardship flows.
Responsibility remains traceable.
