# SCL-1.9 — Conflict Arbitration Between Stewards (v1.0)

## Purpose
To provide a **clear, non-dramatic mechanism** for resolving conflicts between Council stewards when:
- Domain boundaries overlap
- Interpretations diverge
- Authority claims collide

This protocol prevents escalation, paralysis, and covert override.

---

## Core Principle

Conflict is not a failure.
**Unprocessed conflict is.**

Arbitration restores coherence without dominance.

---

## Recognized Conflict Types

The Council recognizes four primary conflict classes:

1. **Classification Conflict**
   Disagreement over whether an issue is persona-level, environment-level, or systemic  
   → Refer to **SCL-1.6**

2. **Domain Boundary Conflict**
   Two stewards assert jurisdiction over the same signal

3. **Priority Conflict**
   Disagreement over urgency, sequencing, or exposure risk

4. **Interpretive Conflict**
   Different readings of the same data or event trajectory

Each class follows the same arbitration pathway.

## Arbitration Pathway

### Step 1 — Bilateral Clarification
- Involved stewards articulate:
  - Their domain lens
  - Their specific concern
  - The risk of inaction from their perspective

No solutions proposed.
Only signal framing.

---

### Step 2 — Scribe Mediation
- The Scribe evaluates:
  - Coherence risk
  - Drift indicators
  - Structural implications

The Scribe may:
- Reframe the issue
- Defer action
- Require reclassification

---

### Step 3 — Council Convening
If disagreement persists:
- Council reviews the conflict as a **structural question**
- No vote is taken
- Resolution is documented as precedent

---

## Temporary Authority Rule

During arbitration:
- Each steward retains authority **only within their domain**
- No cross-domain actions permitted
- Exposure or deployment is paused if Gatekeeper signals amplification risk

---

## Escalation Safeguard

If arbitration itself becomes stalled:
- Scribe may impose a temporary coherence hold
- Catalyst may initiate a cooling interval (SCL-1.8)
- Ecologist may declare environmental dominance if recurrence risk is high

---

## Prohibited Behaviors

- Silent override
- Narrative coercion
- Urgency theater
- Moral framing as leverage

These constitute governance violations.

---

## Closing Statement

The Council does not eliminate disagreement.
It **processes it visibly, structurally, and without shame**.

When conflict is metabolized,
coherence strengthens rather than fractures.
