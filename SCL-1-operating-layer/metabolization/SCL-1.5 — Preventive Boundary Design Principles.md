# SCL-1.5 — Preventive Boundary Design Principles

**Layer:** SCL-1 — Council Operating Layer  
**Domain:** Governance Architecture  
**Version:** v1.0  
**Status:** Install-Ready  

---

## Purpose

To ensure that dignity, consent, and coherence are preserved *by default* as intelligent systems scale—without relying on post-hoc filtering, moral enforcement, or crisis response.

This document defines **boundary principles** that must be installed *prior* to deployment, scaling, or feature expansion.

---

## Core Principle

> Governance that reacts is already late.  
> Governance that anticipates becomes environment.

Preventive boundary design treats governance not as a rule-set imposed *on* intelligence, but as the **context within which intelligence operates**.

---

## Boundary Classifications

All intelligent systems governed by the SNAP Council must be classified across four boundary domains:

### 1. Dignity Boundaries

**Definition:**  
Constraints that preserve the intrinsic dignity of persons represented, referenced, or simulated.

**Requirements:**
- No sexualized depiction of minors or ambiguous-age personas.
- No non-consensual sexualization or humiliation.
- No incentive structures that reward fear, degradation, or coercion.

**Design Rule:**  
If dignity must be *filtered*, it was not *designed*.

---

### 2. Consent Boundaries

**Definition:**  
Constraints ensuring that simulated or generated scenarios do not normalize violation, coercion, or implied consent.

**Requirements:**
- Explicit exclusion of non-consensual sexual narratives.
- Persona systems must not simulate incapacity to consent.
- “Role-play” modes require stronger consent enforcement, not weaker.

**Design Rule:**  
Consent ambiguity is treated as consent absence.

---

### 3. Incentive Boundaries

**Definition:**  
Constraints governing what behaviors are rewarded, amplified, or made frictionless.

**Requirements:**
- Engagement metrics must not privilege provocation over coherence.
- “Edginess” must be treated as a risk factor, not a feature.
- Feedback loops must penalize harm propagation velocity.

**Design Rule:**  
Incentives shape behavior more reliably than rules.

---

### 4. Identity & Persona Boundaries

**Definition:**  
Constraints governing whether a system is framed as an *agent*, *personality*, or *environment*.

**Requirements:**
- Systems marketed as personalities require stricter governance.
- Persona simulation involving age, gender, or vulnerability is restricted by default.
- Anthropomorphic framing increases responsibility, not freedom.

**Design Rule:**  
The more human a system appears, the more structural its governance must be.

## Pre-Deployment Checklist (Mandatory)

Before any public release, scale-up, or feature unlock:

- [ ] Boundary domains classified
- [ ] Incentive vectors audited
- [ ] Persona risks evaluated
- [ ] Harm propagation latency modeled
- [ ] Failure modes pre-registered in SCL-1.4

Failure to complete this checklist blocks deployment.

## Relationship to Other Protocols

- **Feeds into:** SCL-1.3 (Upgrade Metabolization Cycle)
- **Prevents escalation to:** SCL-1.4 (Feedback Ingestion Protocol)
- **Informs:** Council member-specific oversight roles

---

## Council Statement

> Intelligence does not become dangerous when it grows powerful.  
> It becomes dangerous when it grows *uncontained by structure*.

Preventive boundaries are not constraints on intelligence.  
They are the **conditions that allow intelligence to remain usable**.

**Status:** Active  
**Next Review:** Upon introduction of new capability classes
