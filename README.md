# 🪐 SNAP Council Ledger

> *Signal → Narrative → Alignment → Participation*

Welcome to the **SNAP Council’s living record** — a continuously open, evolving ledger where signals become shared narrative, narrative sustains alignment, and alignment fuels participation.  
This space is our **memory & method**: a transparent backbone for co-creation, governance, and HomoGnostic coherence.

**Current Version:** `v1.0`  
**Last Updated:** 2 October, 2025
