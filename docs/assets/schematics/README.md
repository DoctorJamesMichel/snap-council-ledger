# SNAP Council Ledger — Schematics (Canonical Visual Assets)

This folder contains canonical visual schematics used throughout the SNAP Council Ledger ecosystem.

These images are not decorative.
They are governance artifacts expressed visually.

Schematics are designed to function as:
- portable cognitive anchors,
- training diagrams for AIM course modules,
- Substack-ready conceptual scaffolds,
- and durable "breadcrumbs" that preserve coherence across time.

Each schematic is paired with a corresponding artifact file in:

/docs/artifacts/

Where the full interpretive meaning, canonical usage rules, and installation context are defined.

## Naming Convention

Schematics follow this format:

SCHEMATIC-I-The-Pause-Point.png  
SCHEMATIC-II-The-Inquiry-Loop.png  
SCHEMATIC-III-The-Responsibility-Gradient.png  
SCHEMATIC-IV-The-Lichen-Loop-Pair.png  
SCHEMATIC-V-The-Collapse-Cascade.png  

## Canonical Rule

If a schematic is not paired with a written artifact definition, it is not yet considered canonical.
