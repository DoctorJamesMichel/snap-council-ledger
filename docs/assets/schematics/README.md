# SNAP Council Ledger — Schematics (Canonical Visual Assets)

This folder contains canonical visual schematics used throughout the SNAP Council Ledger ecosystem.

These images are not decorative.

They are **governance artifacts expressed visually**—portable cognitive anchors designed to preserve coherence across time, scale, and system complexity.

Schematics are intended to function as:

- portable cognitive anchors,
- training diagrams for AIM course modules,
- Substack-ready conceptual scaffolds,
- and durable “breadcrumbs” that prevent drift across time.

Each schematic is paired with a corresponding interpretive artifact file located in:

`/docs/artifacts/`

Where its full meaning, canonical usage rules, and installation context are defined.

## Naming Convention

All canonical schematics follow this filename format:

`SCHEMATIC-[RomanNumeral]-[Title].png`

Example:

`SCHEMATIC-IV-The-Lichen-Loop-Pair.png`

---

## Canonical Rule

If a schematic is not paired with a written artifact definition in `/docs/artifacts/`, it is **not yet considered canonical**.

Schematics become canonical only when they have:

- a stable filename,
- a defined conceptual purpose,
- a declared usage context,
- and an artifact entry describing how the schematic is invoked.

---

## Governance Function (Summary)

Schematics are designed to support:

- consequence-aware thinking,
- upstream responsibility installation,
- drift prevention,
- epistemic stabilization,
- and reusable learning transmission across time.
