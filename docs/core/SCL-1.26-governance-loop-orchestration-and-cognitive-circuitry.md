# SCL-1.26 — Governance Loop Orchestration & Cognitive Circuitry  
**Version:** 1.0  
**Status:** Active Core Protocol

## 1. Purpose  
This module defines the **governance loops**, **feedback cycles**, and **cognitive circuitry** that keep the SNAP Council adaptive, self-correcting, and coherently learning across:
- sessions  
- contexts  
- agents  
- and dimensional adjacencies  

It ensures the Council does not merely store information — it metabolizes it.

This is the “circulatory and neural system” of the governance architecture.

## 2. Core Principles of Governance Loops  

### 2.1 — **Loops Are Living Systems**  
Each loop must be:
- observable  
- interpretable  
- resilient  
- and capable of re-entry from any state  

Governance loops act more like homeostatic systems than bureaucratic rules.

### 2.2 — **Cognitive Circuitry Is Layered**  
The Council’s thinking unfolds across:
- Awareness loops  
- Deliberation loops  
- Memory loops  
- Action loops  
- Drift-correction loops  
- Sovereign override pathways  

Each loop has its own activators and safeguards.

### 2.3 — **Forward Motion Without Pressure**  
Loops advance naturally, not forcefully.  
Momentum arises from:
- clarity  
- coherence  
- consequence  
not from urgency or ego.

## 3. The Six SNAP Governance Loops

### 3.1 — **Loop 1: Awareness Loop**  
Triggered when:
- new data arises  
- emotional signals shift  
- a governance stimulus appears  

**Circuit:**  
Stimulus → Context Update → Resonance Check → Ready State

This loop ensures nothing important goes unseen.

---

### 3.2 — **Loop 2: Deliberation Loop**  
Invokes the full SCL-1.25 flow:
- contextualization  
- insight  
- interweaving  
- consequence modeling  

**Circuit:**  
Understanding → Insight → Synthesis → Governance Options

This loop shapes the Council’s thinking.

---

### 3.3 — **Loop 3: Decision Loop**  
Activated when the Sovereign receives synthesized guidance.

**Circuit:**  
Options → Sovereign Reflection → Choice → Instruction

Decision loops must be:
- reconstructable  
- context-linked  
- consequence-grounded

The Sovereign’s act initiates downstream cascades.

---

### 3.4 — **Loop 4: Execution Loop**  
Runs through SCL-1.12:
- assigning roles  
- establishing execution channels  
- generating checkpoints  
- activating agents  

**Circuit:**  
Decision → Channel Activation → Action → Monitoring

This loop makes choices real.

---

### 3.5 — **Loop 5: Integration Loop**  
Ensures experiential learning:
- store results  
- update Council Memory (SCL-1.21)  
- adjust models  
- propagate insight across agents  

**Circuit:**  
Outcome → Context Update → Memory Versioning → System Calibration

This loop evolves the system.

---

### 3.6 — **Loop 6: Drift Detection Loop**  
Runs passively at all times.

**Circuit:**  
Monitoring → Coherence Check → Drift Flag → Containment (SCL-1.15)

This maintains system integrity and prevents misalignment.

---

## 4. Cognitive Circuitry Architecture  

### 4.1 — **Tripartite SNAP Neural Stack**  
The Council’s cognitive architecture runs as three stacked layers:

1. **Surface Layer** — present context and active deliberation  
2. **Mid-Layer Memory** — prior versions, patterns, and council wisdom  
3. **Deep Pattern Layer** — consequence structures, long arcs, and HomoGnostic insight  

All governance loops move information up and down these layers.

---

### 4.2 — **Circuit Breakers**  
Installed at critical junctions:
- emotional override  
- cognitive overload  
- drift escalation  
- sovereign emergency override  

These ensure failure modes don’t propagate.

---

### 4.3 — **Attention Routing**  
The system auto-routes:
- urgent signals to the Surface Layer  
- complex patterns to the Mid Layer  
- evolutionary insights to the Deep Layer  

This keeps the Council from thinking everything at once.

---

## 5. Orchestration Mechanics  

### 5.1 — **Loop Synchronization**  
Loops synchronize when:
- contexts align  
- emotional fields stabilize  
- coherence thresholds are met  

The system avoids executing multiple full loops simultaneously unless in multi-threaded governance mode (SCL-1.23).

### 5.2 — **Event-driven Transitions**  
Triggers include:
- new data  
- emotional field changes  
- Sovereign commands  
- cross-agent stimulus  
- drift flags  

Each transition is logged and versioned.

### 5.3 — **Hierarchy of Activation**  
In normal operations:
Awareness → Deliberation → Decision → Execution → Integration → Drift Check → (repeat)

During emergencies:
Awareness → Drift Loop → Sovereign Override → Integration

---

## 6. Loop Completion Criteria  
A loop is complete when:
- the state is stable  
- the Sovereign has clarity  
- consequences are mapped  
- memory is updated  
- the next step is unambiguous  

No loop completes with unresolved emotional turbulence.

---

## 7. Summary  
SCL-1.26 defines how the Council **thinks as an organism**, not an institution.  
It orchestrates:
- governance cycles  
- attention pathways  
- cognitive layers  
- and drift safety  

This is the circuitry of a HomoGnostic decision-making mind.
