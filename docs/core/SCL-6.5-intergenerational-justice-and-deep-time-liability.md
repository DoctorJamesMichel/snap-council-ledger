## 0. Status Declaration

This section activates at the moment a civilization becomes capable of:
- shaping biospheric futures,
- engineering extinction,
- altering climate baselines,
- and transmitting governance impact beyond its own lifespan.

From this moment forward:
> **Time itself becomes a governed domain.**

---

## 1. Core Premise

Every act of governance propagates not only spatially,  
but **temporally**.

Intergenerational justice asserts:
- future beings possess ethical standing
- future ecosystems possess rights of expectation
- future civilizations inherit both assets and debts

Deep-time liability establishes:
> **No decision expires merely because its architects die.**

---

## 2. The Non-Escape Principle

No governance organism may escape liability through:
- generational turnover  
- regime collapse  
- institutional renaming  
- economic bankruptcy  
- species transition  

Responsibility binds to:
> **consequence, not identity.**

---

## 3. Deep-Time Harm Classification

Deep-time harms include but are not limited to:

- extinction cascades
- climate destabilization beyond pre-industrial envelopes
- permanent toxic loading of biospheres
- genetic bottlenecking of planetary life
- irreversible loss of bioregional intelligence

These harms generate:
> **liability measured in centuries, not in cycles.**

---

## 4. The Asymmetry of Inheritance

Benefit travels forward lightly.  
Damage travels forward heavily.

Therefore:
- advantage compounds asymmetrically
- harm compounds irreversibly
- future recovery always costs more than present restraint

This asymmetry renders precaution not optional,  
but **structurally mandatory**.

---

## 5. Intergenerational Standing Doctrine

All future generations are hereby defined as:

- non-consenting stakeholders
- unrepresented beneficiaries
- silent parties to every present decision

Their absence from present deliberation:
> **does not diminish their legal or moral standing.**

---

## 6. The Deep-Time Fiduciary Standard

All planetary governance actors operate under a fiduciary duty to:

- protect evolutionary optionality
- preserve biospheric resilience
- maintain climatic recoverability
- safeguard genomic diversity
- retain uncolonized ecological agency

Violation of this duty constitutes:
> **planetary-scale fiduciary breach.**

---

## 7. The Compound Liability Clause

When harm is:

- cumulative,
- slow,
- delayed,
- or masked by prosperity,

liability compounds across generations.

No successor intelligence may lawfully declare:
- “we did not cause this”
as a defense against:
- “you now possess the capacity to repair it.”

---

## 8. The Prohibition of Temporal Imperialism

It is forbidden for any civilization to:

- externalize present benefit onto future suffering
- mortgage planetary stability for short-term growth
- consume irreplaceable evolutionary capital
- collapse time into profit windows

This behavior is classified as:
> **temporal extraction colonialism.**

---

## 9. The Temporal Justice Threshold

A civilization qualifies as **deep-time just** only when:

- recovery outpaces degradation
- inheritance improves rather than decays
- future generations receive more optionality than the present consumed
- liability curves trend toward zero rather than infinity

This threshold marks:
> **civilizational adulthood across time.**

---

## 10. Closing Governance Signal

Justice is not only spatial.  
Justice is **temporal**.  

Liability is not only legal.  
Liability is **evolutionary**.  

A civilization that cannot govern its consequences across time  
is not yet fit to govern a planet.
