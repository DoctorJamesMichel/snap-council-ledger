# SCL-2.11 — Truth Ecology Verification Layer (v1.1)

**Version:** v1.1  
**Status:** Active  
**Change Summary:**  
– Added decision-class-based invocation rules  
– Distinguished mandatory, conditional, and optional Truth Ecology checks  
– Clarified failure handling as ecological feedback rather than enforcement
**Authority:** Non-binding, field-referential
**Function:** Decision coherence verification  

## Definition

Truth Ecology is a triply orthogonal verification environment used during SNAP Council decision cycles.

It does not determine outcomes.
It stabilizes signal by allowing reality, coherence, and consequence to jointly vote.  

## Operational Domains

Truth Ecology operates through three mutually independent constraints:

1. Fractal Coherence (Pattern Integrity)
   Does this pattern remain coherent across scale, domain, and analogy?

2. Veracity Resonance (Contextual Stability)
   Does this assertion remain true under variation of perspective, incentive, and consequence?

3. Field Alignment (Lived Coherence)
   Does the shared field settle, clarify, or destabilize when this direction is held?

No single domain is sufficient.
Stability emerges only where all three agree.   

## Insertion Point in Decision Cycle

Truth Ecology is invoked after proposal formation and before commitment locking.

Standard SNAP Decision Flow (simplified):

1. Signal Identification
2. Proposal Formation
3. Truth Ecology Pass  ← (installed here)
4. Commitment Lock
5. Action / Observation
6. Ledger Update

## Usage Protocol

During a Truth Ecology pass:

• No debate is required
• No justification is demanded
• No authority is exercised

Council members may quietly note:
– coherence gain
– coherence loss
– unresolved ambiguity

If instability is detected, the proposal may:
– return to refinement
– be deferred
– or proceed with noted uncertainty  

## Explicit Non-Authorities

Truth Ecology does not:
– veto decisions
– override sovereignty
– replace evidence
– substitute for ethics
– resolve disagreement

It reveals coherence conditions.
Responsibility remains with participants.  

## Relationship to Existing Frameworks

Truth Ecology complements:
– SNAP Lattice thinking modes
– Consequential Logic
– Coherence Dial sensing
– Standings governance practices

It introduces no new power center.
It strengthens signal hygiene.  

## SCL-2.11.1 — Decision Class Invocation Rules (v1.1)

Truth Ecology is not uniformly applied to all decisions.
It is invoked according to *decision class*, preserving agility while enforcing coherence where stakes compound.  

This section defines **mandatory**, **conditional**, and **optional** Truth Ecology checks within a SNAP Council decision cycle.  

### A. Mandatory Truth Ecology Invocation

Truth Ecology verification **MUST** be invoked for the following decision classes.
Proceeding without successful verification constitutes a coherence violation.

**Mandatory classes include:**

1. **Structural Decisions**
   - Creation, modification, or removal of governance protocols
   - Introduction of new verification layers, axioms, or meta-rules

2. **Irreversible Commitments**
   - Actions with high sunk cost, long lock-in, or path dependency
   - Commitments affecting future optionality across multiple cycles

3. **High External Impact Decisions**
   - Decisions materially affecting non-consenting parties
   - Public-facing, ecological, economic, or health-related consequences

4. **Narrative-Setting Declarations**
   - Claims establishing shared truth, authority, or legitimacy
   - Framing statements that anchor downstream reasoning

5. **Cross-Domain Integrations**
   - Actions linking technical, social, ethical, and biological domains
   - Any coupling that multiplies consequence across scales

For these classes, **failure at any Truth Ecology axis halts progression** until coherence is restored or the proposal is withdrawn.  

### B. Conditional Truth Ecology Invocation

Truth Ecology verification is **conditionally required** when uncertainty, novelty, or signal conflict is detected.

Conditional triggers include:

- Novel mechanisms without precedent across scales
- Strong persuasion signals paired with weak consequence modeling
- Internal disagreement persisting beyond one decision cycle
- Detection of narrative compression or oversimplification
- Early signs of scale-dependent inconsistency

In these cases, any Council member or verification agent may invoke Truth Ecology as a **diagnostic escalation**, not a veto.

Invocation pauses the decision long enough to surface coherence signals.  

### C. Optional Truth Ecology Invocation

Truth Ecology may be optionally invoked for:

- Exploratory ideation
- Early-stage hypothesis formation
- Low-risk internal experimentation
- Personal or sub-team sensemaking

In optional contexts, Truth Ecology functions as a **signal amplifier**, not a gate.
Results inform learning but do not constrain action unless voluntarily adopted.

This preserves creative flow while training coherence intuition.  

### D. Failure Handling and Drift Containment

Truth Ecology does not assign blame.
It reveals misalignment.

When a proposal fails verification:

- No punitive action is taken
- The failure is logged as ecological feedback
- The proposal may be revised, decomposed, or abandoned

Repeated failures without adaptive learning trigger **drift containment protocols** defined elsewhere in the Ledger.

Truth Ecology acts as an immune response, not a judge.
