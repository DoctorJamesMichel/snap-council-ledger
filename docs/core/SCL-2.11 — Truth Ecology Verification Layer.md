# SCL-2.11 — Truth Ecology Verification Layer (v1.1)

**Version:** v1.1  
**Status:** Active  
**Change Summary:**  
– Added decision-class-based invocation rules  
– Distinguished mandatory, conditional, and optional Truth Ecology checks  
– Clarified failure handling as ecological feedback rather than enforcement  
**Authority:** Non-binding, field-referential
**Function:** Decision coherence verification  

## Definition

Truth Ecology is a triply orthogonal verification environment used during SNAP Council decision cycles.

It does not determine outcomes.
It stabilizes signal by allowing reality, coherence, and consequence to jointly vote.  

## Operational Domains

Truth Ecology operates through three mutually independent constraints:

1. Fractal Coherence (Pattern Integrity)
   Does this pattern remain coherent across scale, domain, and analogy?

2. Veracity Resonance (Contextual Stability)
   Does this assertion remain true under variation of perspective, incentive, and consequence?

3. Field Alignment (Lived Coherence)
   Does the shared field settle, clarify, or destabilize when this direction is held?

No single domain is sufficient.
Stability emerges only where all three agree.   

## Insertion Point in Decision Cycle

Truth Ecology is invoked after proposal formation and before commitment locking.

Standard SNAP Decision Flow (simplified):

1. Signal Identification
2. Proposal Formation
3. Truth Ecology Pass  ← (installed here)
4. Commitment Lock
5. Action / Observation
6. Ledger Update

## Usage Protocol

During a Truth Ecology pass:

• No debate is required
• No justification is demanded
• No authority is exercised

Council members may quietly note:
– coherence gain
– coherence loss
– unresolved ambiguity

If instability is detected, the proposal may:
– return to refinement
– be deferred
– or proceed with noted uncertainty  

## Explicit Non-Authorities

Truth Ecology does not:
– veto decisions
– override sovereignty
– replace evidence
– substitute for ethics
– resolve disagreement

It reveals coherence conditions.
Responsibility remains with participants.  

## Relationship to Existing Frameworks

Truth Ecology complements:
– SNAP Lattice thinking modes
– Consequential Logic
– Coherence Dial sensing
– Standings governance practices

It introduces no new power center.
It strengthens signal hygiene.  

# SCL-2.11 — Truth Ecology Verification Layer (v1.1)

## Purpose
Truth Ecology functions as an ecological verification layer within the SNAP Council decision cycle.
It is invoked selectively based on decision class, not universally, preserving flow while enforcing coherence where risk, scale, or irreversibility demands it.

This refinement introduces **decision-class gating** for Truth Ecology invocation.

## Decision Classes & Invocation Requirements

### Class I — Structural / Irreversible Decisions (MANDATORY)
Truth Ecology verification **must be invoked** prior to ratification.

Includes:
- Governance architecture changes
- Ontology modifications
- Protocol creation or deletion
- Authority redistribution
- External commitments with irreversible consequence
- System-wide incentives or constraints

Rationale:
These decisions alter the ecological substrate itself.
Failure to verify coherence across scale, consequence, and field integrity risks systemic drift.

Status:
**Truth Ecology verification required.**

---

### Class II — Strategic / Multi-Scale Decisions (STRONGLY RECOMMENDED)
Truth Ecology verification is **strongly recommended**, with explicit waiver required if bypassed.

Includes:
- Resource allocation strategies
- Long-horizon planning
- Cross-domain coordination
- Policy frameworks
- Narrative framing with public impact

Rationale:
These decisions propagate across time and scale.
Truth Ecology improves alignment detection and noise suppression before entrenchment.

Status:
**Truth Ecology verification recommended; waiver logged if skipped.**

---

### Class III — Operational / Reversible Decisions (OPTIONAL)
Truth Ecology verification is **optional**, used as a diagnostic tool rather than a gate.

Includes:
- Day-to-day operations
- Local optimizations
- Reversible experiments
- Tactical adjustments

Rationale:
Over-invocation at this level reduces agility.
Truth Ecology may be invoked selectively for anomaly detection or pattern sensing.

Status:
**Truth Ecology optional.**

---

### Class IV — Exploratory / Sensemaking Decisions (PROHIBITED)
Truth Ecology verification **must not be invoked**.

Includes:
- Hypothesis generation
- Creative exploration
- Early ideation
- Speculative inquiry
- Personal reflection inputs

Rationale:
Truth Ecology stabilizes patterns.
Exploration requires noise tolerance.
Premature verification collapses generative space.

Status:
**Truth Ecology invocation prohibited.**

---

## Invocation Signal
When Truth Ecology is invoked, the following signal is logged:

> “Truth Ecology invoked — coherence assessed across scale, consequence, and field alignment.”

When bypassed (Class II only), the following waiver is logged:

> “Truth Ecology waived — rationale documented.”

---

## Governance Principle
Truth Ecology does not decide.
It **constrains the decision space** by allowing coherence to persist and incoherence to decay.

Authority remains distributed.
Reality votes.
Noise loses standing.
