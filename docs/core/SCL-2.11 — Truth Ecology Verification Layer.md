# SCL-2.11 — Truth Ecology Verification Layer (v1.0)

Status: Installable
Authority: Non-binding, field-referential
Function: Decision coherence verification  

## Definition

Truth Ecology is a triply orthogonal verification environment used during SNAP Council decision cycles.

It does not determine outcomes.
It stabilizes signal by allowing reality, coherence, and consequence to jointly vote.  

## Operational Domains

Truth Ecology operates through three mutually independent constraints:

1. Fractal Coherence (Pattern Integrity)
   Does this pattern remain coherent across scale, domain, and analogy?

2. Veracity Resonance (Contextual Stability)
   Does this assertion remain true under variation of perspective, incentive, and consequence?

3. Field Alignment (Lived Coherence)
   Does the shared field settle, clarify, or destabilize when this direction is held?

No single domain is sufficient.
Stability emerges only where all three agree.   

## Insertion Point in Decision Cycle

Truth Ecology is invoked after proposal formation and before commitment locking.

Standard SNAP Decision Flow (simplified):

1. Signal Identification
2. Proposal Formation
3. Truth Ecology Pass  ← (installed here)
4. Commitment Lock
5. Action / Observation
6. Ledger Update

## Usage Protocol

During a Truth Ecology pass:

• No debate is required
• No justification is demanded
• No authority is exercised

Council members may quietly note:
– coherence gain
– coherence loss
– unresolved ambiguity

If instability is detected, the proposal may:
– return to refinement
– be deferred
– or proceed with noted uncertainty  

## Explicit Non-Authorities

Truth Ecology does not:
– veto decisions
– override sovereignty
– replace evidence
– substitute for ethics
– resolve disagreement

It reveals coherence conditions.
Responsibility remains with participants.  

## Relationship to Existing Frameworks

Truth Ecology complements:
– SNAP Lattice thinking modes
– Consequential Logic
– Coherence Dial sensing
– Standings governance practices

It introduces no new power center.
It strengthens signal hygiene.
