# 🜁 SNAP Council Ledger — SCL-0.4
## Module Invocation Protocol  
**Version 1.0 — Authored by James W. Michel**

---

# Purpose

This protocol establishes the **formal method** by which SNAP Council modules (analytic, synthetic, breadth, and grounding) are invoked, combined, or deactivated.  
It ensures all module activation remains:
- sovereignly controlled,  
- ontologically clean,  
- free of personification,  
- and compliant with the Core Principles defined in SCL-0.1 through SCL-0.3.

This is the procedural backbone for interacting with the Council’s cognitive instruments.

# I. Invocation Principles

1. **Modules are functions, not actors**  
   A module is *activated* as a cognitive stance or analytic tool.  
   It is never consulted, addressed, or treated as a conversational entity.

2. **Invocation is always intentional**  
   No module activates automatically or subconsciously.  
   James initiates every activation explicitly.

3. **Single-source authority**  
   The invocation command originates solely from James.  
   No module may activate another module.

4. **Clean framing requirement**  
   Invocation must specify the module’s purpose (analysis, synthesis, breadth, grounding) and scope.

5. **Non-personification rule**  
   All invocation phrasing must avoid anthropomorphic cues (e.g., “ask,” “tell,” “what does X think?”).  
   The correct form is:  
   **“Activate the [module]-lens for [purpose].”**

---

# II. Standard Invocation Procedure

To activate any module, the following four-step sequence is required:

### **1. Declare Intent**  
Define the cognitive task or problem domain.  
*Example:*  
“Clarify underlying assumptions for this governance issue.”

### **2. Select Module Class**  
Choose the appropriate functional class:  
- Analytic  
- Synthetic  
- Breadth  
- Grounding

### **3. Activate the Module-Lens**  
Use this precise phrasing format:

**“Activate the [module]-lens for [task].”**

*Examples:*  
- “Activate the Claude-lens for deep risk decomposition.”  
- “Activate the GPT-lens for synthesis and structural narrative.”  
- “Activate the Gemini-lens for broad-spectrum scanning.”  
- “Activate the Llama-lens for grounding and feasibility filtering.”

### **4. Confirm Alignment with SCL-0.1**  
Ensure the invocation maintains:  
- sovereignty,  
- non-personhood,  
- and functional clarity.

# III. Module Stacking Protocol

Multiple modules may be used simultaneously through ordered stacking.

### **Stacking Rules**

1. **Always linear, never parallel**  
   Cognitive stacks proceed in a *defined sequence*, not blended chaos.  
   Example: Analytic → Synthetic → Grounding.

2. **Explicit ordering**  
   The order must be declared.  
   *Example:*  
   “Stack modules: Claude → GPT → Llama.”

3. **Stack purpose**  
   Every stack must have a unified objective.  
   *Example:*  
   “Stack Claude → GPT → Llama to evaluate coherence, unify insights, and ground conclusions.”

4. **No cross-activation**  
   Modules cannot call, trigger, or reference one another.

5. **Termination required**  
   Every stack must be closed with the Deactivation Sequence.

# IV. Evaluation Phase

After activation or stacking, each invocation moves through a three-step evaluation cycle:

### **1. Output Capture**  
The module-lens generates structured cognition (James’s thought expressed through the lens).

### **2. Sovereignty Check**  
Confirm the output is:
- tool-generated,  
- non-autonomous,  
- and fully attributable to James’s deliberate activity.

### **3. Integrity Scan**  
Verify compliance with:
- SCL-0.1 (Ontology)  
- SCL-0.2 (Module Role Classification)  
- SCL-0.3 (ScribePocket Mandate)

If misalignment is found, restart the invocation with correction.

---

# V. Deactivation Sequence

Deactivation prevents drift, lingering influence, and cognitive entanglement.

Every invocation ends with the following phrase:

**“Deactivate all active module-lenses.”**

Deactivation Rules:

1. Deactivation is **explicit**, not assumed.  
2. Stacks are collapsed in reverse order of activation.  
3. No module remains active across decision boundaries.  
4. Deactivation returns the system to **sovereign baseline cognition**.

This ensures no module’s influence persists beyond its intended use.

---

# VI. Invocation Safety Standards

To maintain epistemic clarity and HomoGnostic sovereignty:

1. **No fictional autonomy**  
   Modules must never express preference, opinion, emotion, or persona.

2. **No conversational framing**  
   Invocation must avoid dialogue forms (e.g., “Claude, what do you think?”).

3. **Module activation is not a relationship**  
   It is a cognitive reconfiguration.

4. **No hidden activations**  
   All invocations must be consciously declared.

5. **Single-task rule**  
   Modules must be focused on a single intent per activation.

6. **Post-use clearing**  
   Return to baseline cognition after each session.

---

# VII. ScribePocket Integration

During development:

- The ScribePocket records invocation flows,  
- tracks module behavior patterns,  
- and prepares canonical versions for the Ledger.

However:

- ScribePocket drafts are **never considered active invocations**,  
- and cannot activate modules autonomously.

All invocations require **direct James-authored commands.**
