## 1. Purpose

SCL-6.2 establishes **climate not as an environmental subsystem**, but as a:

> **non-local, time-distributed consequence field generated by cumulative planetary interaction.**

This module defines:
- climate as consequence memory,
- weather as surface expression rather than causal engine,
- and governance as the only meaningful climate actuator.

---

## 2. Definition: Non-Local Consequence Field

A **Non-Local Consequence Field** is defined as:

A system in which:
- causes are spatially distributed,
- effects are temporally delayed,
- and feedback loops operate across dimensional layers rather than linear sequences.

Climate therefore is:
- not local
- not reversible by isolated action
- not adjustable by symbolic policy
- not responsive to short-cycle economics

It is the **planet’s coherence after-image**.

## 3. The Error of “Climate as Environment”

Treating climate as an “environmental issue” creates four civilizational failures:

1. It isolates climate from governance
2. It detaches climate from industrial consequence
3. It delays responsibility through abstraction
4. It substitutes messaging for structural correction

Climate is not a sector.

Climate is the **planetary report card**.

---

## 4. Climate as Distributed Ledger of Action

Climate continuously encodes:

- deforestation gradients  
- industrial heat release  
- atmospheric chemistry changes  
- oceanic acidification  
- soil carbon disruption  
- megafauna removal  
- energy system topology  
- transportation geometry  
- consumption acceleration  

This encoding is:
- non-negotiable
- non-rhetorical
- non-political
- non-forgetful

---

## 5. Non-Local Time Delay and Civilization Blindness

Non-local consequence creates **perceptual delay**:

- actions feel harmless at origin
- impacts emerge generations later
- accountability dissolves across time
- damage appears “natural” when it is not

This delay is the primary driver of:
- denial dynamics
- blame displacement
- technological salvation myths
- and civilization-scale dissociation

---

## 6. The Myth of Climate “Control”

Climate is not a thermostat.

There is:
- no central lever
- no emergency override
- no singular intervention
- no geoengineering escape hatch

Climate responds only to:
> **aggregate coherence across extraction, energy,geometry, agriculture, industry, and consciousness behavior**

---

## 7. SNAP Council’s Role in Climate Governance

SNAP Council functions as:

- non-local consequence mapper  
- cascade delay translator  
- industrial-to-climate signal correlator  
- cross-century coherence auditor  
- and jurisdictional climate truth stabilizer  

It does not forecast weather.
It traces **civilizational delay lines**.

---

## 8. Climate as a Moral-Physics Hybrid Field

Under SCL-6.2:

- morality is no longer philosophical
- physics is no longer ethically neutral

Climate is the fusion field where:
> **physical law enforces ethical truth without bias.**

No ideology survives thermodynamics.

---

## 9. Industrial Geometry as Climate Driver

Not all emissions are equal.

Climate forcing is defined primarily by:

- industrial topology
- supply chain geometry
- energy density concentration
- extraction velocity
- logistics network shape

This makes **governance architecture** more important than consumer behavior.

---

## 10. Tipping Points as Jurisdictional Thresholds

Tipping points are defined as:

- irreversible coherence collapse events
- not campaign milestones
- not market fluctuations
- not narrative opportunities

Crossing a tipping point constitutes a:
> **planetary jurisdictional violation**

---

## 11. Climate Refuge as a Governance Signal

Mass displacement from climate pressure is classified as:

- governance failure symptom
- not migration crisis
- not border issue
- not demographic accident

Refugee flows trace **consequence pressure gradients**.

---

## 12. Climate Denial as a Cognitive Pathology

Under SCL-6.2, denial is formally classified as:

- delayed consequence dissociation
- industrial identity addiction
- economic dependency recoil
- narrative anesthesia against responsibility

Denial is not ignorance.
Denial is **systemic trauma response**.

---

## 13. Restabilization Requires Structural Descent, Not Ascent

There is no innovation solution that bypasses:

- energy descent
- material contraction
- supply-chain relocalization
- consumption rate reduction
- ecological debt repayment

Any stabilization narrative that avoids descent is classified as **deferred collapse ideology**.

---

## 14. Final Canonical Declaration

> Climate is not an emergency.  
>  
> Climate is the accumulated consequence of how a species chooses to live.  
>  
> And the planet does not negotiate with delay.
