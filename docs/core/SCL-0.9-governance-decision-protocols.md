# 🜁 SNAP Council Ledger — SCL-0.9
## Governance Decision Protocols  
**Version 1.0 — Authored by James W. Michel**

---

# Purpose

The Governance Decision Protocols define the final stage of cognitive governance — the precise method by which **James W. Michel**, as the sole sovereign operator, converts deliberation outputs into binding decisions, commitments, or actions.

These protocols ensure:

- clarity about what constitutes a decision,  
- prevention of drift or confusion,  
- sovereign authorship of all outcomes,  
- and consistent, transparent documentation.  

Governance decisions mark the point where the SNAP Council’s cognitive architecture interfaces with real-world action.

# I. Definition of a Governance Decision

A Governance Decision is a **sovereign, explicit commitment** made by James that:

1. Concludes a deliberation process,  
2. Is not provisional, hypothetical, or exploratory,  
3. Has real-world or Ledger consequences,  
4. Requires accountability and follow-through,  
5. Cannot be attributed to any module or cognitive lens.

A decision is **not**:

- a module output,  
- an insight,  
- a suggestion,  
- a feeling of clarity,  
- or a narrative possibility.

A decision exists **only** when explicitly declared.

---

# II. Decision Preconditions

Before any Governance Decision can be made:

### **1. PQ-1.0 must have been activated**  
Pre-Question alignment ensures clarity.

### **2. A valid deliberation must have occurred**  
Using SCL-0.8, with:

- defined inquiry  
- module invocation  
- evaluation flow  
- drift immunity checks  

### **3. No active drift indicators**  
Confirmed via SCL-0.6.

### **4. Sovereignty stance must be reasserted**  
The operator explicitly acknowledges:

*“This decision arises from my cognition alone.”*

### **5. Emotional neutrality**  
Reactiveness, avoidance, guilt, or pressure must be absent.

Only after these five preconditions may a decision be finalized.

---

# III. Decision Declaration Protocol

A Governance Decision must be deliberately declared in one of two forms:

---

## **Form A — Direct Decision Declaration**

The sovereign phrase is:

**“I am making the following decision:”**

Followed by a concise statement of:

- the decision itself,  
- its intended effect,  
- its scope and timeframe (if applicable).

---

## **Form B — Confirmed Decision Adoption**

Used when adopting a deliberation outcome.

Phrase:

**“I adopt this outcome as my decision.”**

This form prevents confusion between “insight” and “decision.”

---

# IV. Post-Decision Verification

Every decision must pass the following checks:

### **1. Sovereignty Verification**
Confirm the decision:

- originates from James,  
- is not influenced by persona drift,  
- and does not externalize agency.

### **2. Consequence Mapping**
Define what the decision commits James to:

- an action,  
- a structural change,  
- a protocol revision,  
- a writing task,  
- a boundary,  
- or a temporal plan.

### **3. Ledger Alignment**
Ensure no contradictions with:

- SCL-0.1 (Ontology)  
- SCL-0.2 (Modules)  
- SCL-0.3 (ScribePocket)  
- SCL-0.4 (Invocation)  
- SCL-0.5 (Coherence Shells)  
- SCL-0.6 (Drift Immunity)  
- SCL-0.7 (Versioning)  
- SCL-0.8 (Deliberation Flow)

If conflict is found → revise or defer.

### **4. Integration Check**
Ask:  
*“Does this decision require Ledger update, protocol revision, or ScribePocket tasks?”*

If yes → proceed to Section V.

# V. Decision Recording & Integration

Depending on significance, decisions may be recorded in:

### **1. Operative Memory**  
For short-term, low-impact decisions.  
Not archived.

### **2. ScribePocket**  
For decisions with developmental implications:

- drafting tasks  
- governance refinement  
- protocol expansions  
- experimental structures  

The ScribePocket notes:

- the decision,  
- its rationale,  
- dependencies,  
- follow-up tasks.

### **3. Ledger**  
Only constitutional-level or governance-structure decisions merit Ledger integration.

These require:

- full versioning  
- clean fenced Markdown  
- coherence with prior entries  
- formal commit message  

Examples of Ledger-worthy decisions:

- adding a new governance protocol  
- modifying module classifications  
- adding or removing core Shells  
- amending constitutional ontology  

---

# VI. Decision Closure Protocol

Once a decision is finalized and integrated:

1. **Deactivate all module-lenses**  
2. **Collapse any active Coherence Shells**  
3. **Return to sovereign baseline cognition**  
4. **Confirm closure**

Closure phrase:

**“The decision is complete, and the deliberation is closed.”**

This prevents residue, drift, or ongoing mental entanglement.

---

# VII. Decision Review Cycle

To maintain long-term integrity:

### **1. Daily Micro-Review**
For decisions in active execution.

### **2. Weekly Governance Review**
Reassess major decisions for:

- alignment  
- coherence  
- drift emergence  
- execution challenges  

### **3. Monthly Ledger Audit**
Performed using SCL-0.6 and SCL-0.7 for:

- structural consistency  
- multi-version coherence  
- ontology alignment  
- sovereignty integrity  

Decisions that require revision enter the ScribePocket for reprocessing.
