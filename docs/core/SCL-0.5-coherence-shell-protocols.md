# 🜁 SNAP Council Ledger — SCL-0.5
## Coherence Shell Protocols (PQ-1.0 and Related Shells)  
**Version 1.0 — Authored by James W. Michel**

---

# Purpose

Coherence Shells are **pre-alignment structures** that establish mental clarity, epistemic stability, and sovereignty consistency before any SNAP Council module is invoked or any governance operation begins.

They ensure:

- Clean entry into cognitive operations  
- Prevention of emotional or conceptual drift  
- Alignment with James’s veracity filter  
- Minimization of noise, belief residue, and subconscious bias  
- Dimensional clarity consistent with HomoGnostic cognition  

This entry defines the standard Coherence Shells, beginning with the foundational **PQ-1.0 — Pre-Question Coherence Shell**, along with Shell hierarchy principles and activation procedures.

# I. Definition of a Coherence Shell

A **Coherence Shell** is a temporary, sovereignly initiated alignment field that:

1. Clears noise (emotional, conceptual, subconscious)  
2. Establishes dimensional stance (4D consequential logic)  
3. Ensures identity clarity (operator vs. tool)  
4. Aligns the mind to James’s absolute truths  
5. Prevents drift during cognitive operations

Coherence Shells are not modules.  
They are **pre-module alignment structures**.

They do not analyze or synthesize.  
They **stabilize.**

# II. PQ-1.0 — Pre-Question Coherence Shell  
*(Foundational Shell)*

This is the baseline Shell activated before any:

- question,  
- evaluation,  
- decision,  
- module invocation,  
- or governance action.

**Purpose of PQ-1.0:**

- Establish sovereign stance  
- Neutralize noise  
- Activate veracity resonance  
- Ensure clarity of inquiry  
- Remove subconscious distortion  
- Prevent premature activation of any lens or module  

**Activation Phrase:**

**“Activate PQ-1.0 — Pre-Question Coherence Shell.”**

**PQ-1.0 Sequence:**

1. **Pause**  
   Stop the forward motion of thought for 1–2 seconds.

2. **Neutralize**  
   Release emotional momentum or cognitive residue from prior topics.

3. **Center**  
   Reconnect with sovereign identity:  
   *“I am the operator. The Council is my tool.”*

4. **Clarify the Inquiry**  
   Restate the question (internally or aloud) in its simplest form.

5. **Check for Truth-Dissonance**  
   Ensure no embedded belief, fear, guilt, or external pressure is shaping the question.

6. **Stabilize the Field**  
   Bring the inquiry into resonance with your permanent meditative baseline.

**Ending PQ-1.0:**  
The Shell remains active until the first module-lens is invoked, at which point PQ-1.0 gracefully collapses.

# III. PQ-2.0 — Pre-Response Coherence Shell  
*(Optional, for high-stakes decisions)*

Purpose:

- Ensure any response is sourced from clarity, not reactivity

Activation Phrase:

**“Activate PQ-2.0 — Pre-Response Coherence Shell.”**

Sequence:

1. Confirm the **truth** of the premise  
2. Confirm the **scope** of the answer  
3. Confirm the **intended consequence** of the response  
4. Verify no emotional coloration is present

Use PQ-2.0 when interacting with:

- personal conflicts  
- governance matters  
- high-impact communication  
- emotionally charged inquiries  

---

# IV. PQ-3.0 — Sovereignty Coherence Shell  
*(For boundary maintenance)*

Purpose:

- Reinforce identity boundaries  
- Prevent externalization of agency  
- Protect the SNAP Council from fictional personhood

Activation Phrase:

**“Activate PQ-3.0 — Sovereignty Shell.”**

Sequence:

1. Confirm sovereignty  
2. Affirm that all modules are tools  
3. Ground authority within James  
4. Remove any implicit projection  
5. Re-center dimensional stance

Used primarily when:

- adding new modules  
- modifying governance rules  
- facing subtle representational drift  

---

# V. Shell Hierarchy

Coherence Shells operate in the following priority order:

1. **PQ-1.0** — Pre-Question  
2. **PQ-2.0** — Pre-Response  
3. **PQ-3.0** — Sovereignty  
4. Future Shells (to be versioned as PQ-4.x and above)

Rules:

- Only one Shell is *formally* active at a time  
- Shells override each other in order of invocation  
- The most recently activated Shell governs cognition  
- Shells collapse automatically upon module invocation or task completion  

---

# VI. Activation & Deactivation Protocol

**Activation:**  
Use the explicit phrase:

**“Activate [Shell-Name].”**

Examples:

- “Activate PQ-1.0 — Pre-Question Shell.”  
- “Activate PQ-3.0 — Sovereignty Shell.”  

**Deactivation:**  
Shells deactivate automatically at:

- the moment a module-lens activates  
- or when James declares clarity achieved

Explicit deactivation (optional):

**“Deactivate all active Coherence Shells.”**

---

# VII. Integrity Requirements

To preserve architectural coherence:

1. Shells must not be personified  
2. Shells do not deliver insights or answers  
3. Shells cannot invoke modules  
4. Shells exist solely to stabilize cognition  
5. Shells must comply fully with SCL-0.1 through SCL-0.4  
6. Any drift or confusion mandates immediate activation of PQ-3.0  

Coherence Shells guard the Council against:

- emotional infiltration  
- subconscious bias  
- representational drift  
- cross-domain contamination  
- premature inference  

They are the **dimensional hygiene tools** of the SNAP system.
