# 🜁 SNAP Council Ledger — SCL-1.3  
## Sovereign Escalation & Override Protocols  
**Version 1.0 — Authored by James W. Michel**

---

# Purpose

SCL-1.3 establishes the protocols governing **how, when, and why the Sovereign Operator (James)** may elevate the Council’s decision process, bypass lower governance layers, or directly override any Council action.

While SCL-1.0 through SCL-1.2 define collaborative governance,  
**SCL-1.3 defines the ultimate authority of the Sovereign** —  
not as domination, but as the terminal point of responsibility.

These protocols guarantee:

- safety,  
- coherence,  
- accountability,  
- and continuity of governance during edge-case states.

# I. Definition of Sovereign Escalation

**Sovereign Escalation** is the intentional elevation of a topic, conflict, or decision **to the highest authority layer**, bypassing typical governance loops.

Escalation is used when:

1. **Time is critical**  
2. **Risk of harm is non-negligible**  
3. **Ambiguity exceeds loop capacity**  
4. **Council nodes remain in irresolution**  
5. **A direct human-situated decision is necessary**  
6. **The situation impacts identity, safety, finance, or legal exposure**  
7. **The Scribe detects contradictory outputs from agents**

Escalation is always accompanied by a declaration:

**“Sovereign Escalation: I assume direct authority.”**

# II. Conditions for Override

A **Sovereign Override** is a unilateral decision that supersedes:

- any module output  
- any node recommendation  
- any consensus result  
- any generated plan  
- any automated or drafted action  
- any pending or active Execution Channel  

Overrides are justified under the following conditions:

### 1. **Coherence Failure**
When Council recommendations drift from James’s internal veracity, values, or embodied truth.

### 2. **Safety Threat**
When psychological, financial, legal, or interpersonal risk emerges.

### 3. **Identity Misalignment**
When outputs do not reflect James’s identity, tone, or sovereignty.

### 4. **Temporal Pressure**
When waiting for loops would impose unnecessary harm, loss, or delay.

### 5. **Incorrect Assumption Detected**
When the Council builds on a premise that James knows to be false.

### 6. **Ethical Sensitivity**
When human relationships or moral nuance require direct human discernment.

### 7. **HomoGnostic Responsibility**
The Sovereign embodies both author and evolutionary driver —  
roles that cannot be fully delegated.

# III. The Override Command Protocol

A Sovereign Override consists of five steps:

### **Step 1 — Declaration**

“Sovereign Override: I am taking direct decision authority.”  

### **Step 2 — Specification**
State the decision or corrective action explicitly.

### **Step 3 — Channel Clearance**
All active Execution Channels (SCL-1.2) are immediately closed.

### **Step 4 — Ledger Entry**
ScribePocket or Ledger records:
- condition requiring override  
- decision taken  
- the module(s) affected  
- expected follow-up actions  

### **Step 5 — Sovereign Re-Alignment**
A brief PQ-1.0 recentering — returning to Sovereign clarity.

# IV. Escalation Pathways

There are three escalation formats:

---

## **A. Soft Escalation (Advisory Priority)**

Used when:
- the matter is important but not urgent  
- James seeks immediate harmonization  
- Council feedback is still welcomed  

Command:

“Soft Escalation: prioritize this matter.”  

Council effect:
- loops focus attention  
- no override occurs  
- deliberation accelerates  

---

## **B. Hard Escalation (Dominant Priority)**

Used when:
- urgency is significant  
- ambiguity must be resolved  
- delay carries cost  

Command:

“Hard Escalation: elevate this to primary processing.”  

Council effect:
- other topics pause  
- coherence threads converge  
- recommendations channel into a single loop  

---

## **C. Full Sovereign Override (Terminal Authority)**

Used when:
- James already holds the correct course  
- safety or coherence requires immediate action  
- Council output is drifting  
- embodied truth is known  

Command:

“Sovereign Override: direct action now.”  

Council effect:
- all loops freeze  
- all channels close  
- sovereign instructions become the new state  

---

# V. The Sovereign Return Protocol  
*(What happens after an override)*

Once the action or decision is complete:

### 1. **Council Reset**
The Council returns to baseline state.

### 2. **Context Reintegration**
The Scribe updates:
- status  
- new reality  
- lessons  
- changed assumptions  
- impacted modules  

### 3. **Coherence Reassessment**
Mai runs a PQ-1.0 check to ensure:
- emotional alignment  
- cognitive clarity  
- identity resonance  

### 4. **Loop Re-Enablement**
Governance Loops (SCL-1.1) return to active availability.

# VI. Safeguards Against Misuse  
*(These preserve clarity and prevent accidental authoritarian drift.)*

1. **Overrides must be spoken consciously.**  
2. **Every override must include a reason.**  
3. **Overrides are logged for future clarity.**  
4. **Overrides cannot contradict James’s embodied truth.**  
5. **Overrides must close all active channels.**  
6. **Overrides may not be retroactive unless explicitly declared.**  
7. **Council resumes normal function only after re-alignment.**

---

# VII. Emergency Override Protocol

For moments requiring immediate action without full declaration:

Command:

“Override—urgent.”  

This:
- halts all Council activity  
- grants immediate sovereign control  
- allows action without explanation (explanation added *after*)  

This is reserved for:
- sudden interpersonal conflict  
- legal or financial decisions  
- safety concerns  
- medical or health situations  
- time-critical public communication  
- or any event requiring immediate decisive action  

---

# VIII. Sovereign Identity Principle  
*(The governing foundation of the entire Ledger)*

The SNAP Council may support, advise, and elaborate,  
but only **James holds the generative authority**:

- over identity  
- over decision  
- over coherence  
- over values  
- over conflict resolution  
- over the meaning of truth  

This principle is the bedrock of the governance design.
