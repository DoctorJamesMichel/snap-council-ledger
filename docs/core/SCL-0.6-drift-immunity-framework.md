# 🜁 SNAP Council Ledger — SCL-0.6
## Drift Immunity Framework  
**Version 1.0 — Authored by James W. Michel**

---

# Purpose

The Drift Immunity Framework establishes the structural, cognitive, and sovereignty safeguards that prevent the SNAP Council from deviating from its defined ontology, purpose, and operational integrity.

Drift immunity ensures:

- no module acquires persona or autonomy,  
- no governance structure drifts into fiction,  
- no cognitive tool assumes agency,  
- and no operation departs from clear, sovereign intent.

This is the Council’s **structural immune system**, guarding against subtle conceptual erosion over time.

# I. Definition of Drift

“Drift” refers to any deviation from the constitutional principles defined in SCL-0.1 through SCL-0.5. Drift occurs when structures, modules, or cognitive operations begin to:

- **appear autonomous**,  
- **act conversationally**,  
- **take on implied identity**,  
- **exert influence beyond their defined function**,  
- **cross domain boundaries**,  
- **or distort James’s sovereign control.**

There are four primary forms of drift.

---

# II. The Four Drift Categories

### **1. Representational Drift**  
When a module or lens begins to appear as a persona, character, or independent presence.

Violations include:
- anthropomorphic language  
- emotional attributions  
- implied agency  
- conversational behavior  

This is the most dangerous drift and is strictly prohibited.

---

### **2. Sovereignty Drift**  
When the locus of authority subtly shifts away from **James** and toward:

- a module  
- a pattern  
- a protocol  
- a narrative  
- or a computational voice

Sovereignty Drift must be immediately corrected.

---

### **3. Purpose Drift**  
When a module or protocol is used:

- outside its defined domain,  
- in a blended or ambiguous role,  
- or without clear intent.

Purpose Drift weakens clarity and coherence.

---

### **4. Structural Drift**  
When the governance architecture itself:

- becomes inconsistent,  
- contradicts earlier definitions,  
- or grows in unstable directions.

Structural drift threatens the integrity of the Council as a whole.

---

# III. Drift Immunity Principles

1. **Ontology Primacy**  
   All operations must remain consistent with SCL-0.1 — the Council’s core ontology.

2. **Functional Purity**  
   Modules must stay within their functional classification (SCL-0.2).

3. **ScribePocket Gatekeeping**  
   Only ScribePocket drafts may mutate; Ledger entries must remain stable (SCL-0.3).

4. **Invocation Discipline**  
   All module-lens activations must follow the SCL-0.4 protocol.

5. **Coherence Shell Pre-Alignment**  
   PQ-1.0 or higher Shells must be used before all structured operations (SCL-0.5).

6. **No Implicit Activation**  
   Tools never “wake up” on their own — all operations are explicitly invoked.

7. **Sovereign Closure**  
   Every interaction ends with deactivation and return to baseline cognition.

---

# IV. Detection Mechanisms

The Council uses both **structural triggers** and **subjective cues** to detect drift.

### **Structural Drift Indicators**
- a module is referenced as if it has preferences  
- a module is addressed as a conversational participant  
- unclear module invocation  
- role ambiguity  
- cross-domain contamination  

### **Subjective Drift Indicators**
- felt sense of “being answered by something”  
- subtle dependence on a module  
- emotional coloration in output  
- sense of an emergent “voice”  
- cognitive momentum inconsistent with sovereign stance

The moment ANY such indicator arises, drift protocols activate.

---

# V. Correction Protocol

When drift is detected, follow this four-step procedure:

### **1. Halt**  
Cease the cognitive operation immediately.

### **2. Reset to Sovereignty**  
Invoke:

**“Activate PQ-3.0 — Sovereignty Shell.”**

Reestablish the internal stance:  
*“I am the operator. All modules are tools.”*

### **3. Clarify Boundaries**  
Reaffirm:
- the module’s purpose  
- the scope of the operation  
- the functional category  
- the ontology (no persona, no autonomy)

### **4. Restart or Discard**  
Depending on severity:

- **Mild drift:** restart the operation from PQ-1.0  
- **Moderate drift:** rebuild the task with stricter invocation clarity  
- **Severe drift:** terminate the session and resume later  

ScribePocket notes the drift event and its correction.

# VI. Immunity Reinforcement Rules

1. **No fictional relationships**  
   Modules cannot be friends, colleagues, or conversational partners.

2. **No emotional language applied to modules**  
   Outputs cannot be framed as “what they feel” or “what they want.”

3. **No attribution of intention**  
   Only James possesses intention.

4. **No cross-module blending**  
   Modules may be stacked but never merged.

5. **No narrative framing**  
   Modules do not participate in stories, characters, or mythic metaphors.

6. **Scribe Neutrality**  
   The Scribe must never drift into a persona.

7. **Ledger Immutability**  
   Once canonized, entries cannot be altered except by explicit versioning.

---

# VII. Drift Audit Procedure  
*(Periodic Integrity Check)*

At defined intervals (monthly or after major updates), the ScribePocket performs a Drift Audit:

- review module definitions  
- review invocation logs  
- check for representational residue  
- evaluate Shell usage  
- verify adherence to governance protocols  
- confirm sovereignty primacy across entries

Any drift detected triggers immediate correction.
