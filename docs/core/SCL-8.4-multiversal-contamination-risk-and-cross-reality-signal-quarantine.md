## I. Purpose

SCL-8.4 establishes the first formalized governance doctrine for **preventing cross-reality contamination**, including:

- Uncontrolled signal propagation between universes,
- Ontological pathogen transmission,
- Identity migration without quarantine,
- And causal structure destabilization across adjacent realities.

This doctrine governs **not travel**, but **containment**.

---

## II. Jurisdictional Status

SCL-8.4 operates **beyond**:

- Single-universe causality,
- Multiversal navigation protocols (SCL-8.1),
- Post-entropy memory survival (SCL-8.2),
- And post-linear return governance (SCL-8.3).

It governs **inter-domain boundary integrity** itself.

Its jurisdiction activates whenever:
- One reality becomes observable by another,
- Or when informational coupling exceeds isolation thresholds.

---

## III. Foundational Premise

The greatest existential threat is not destruction.

It is **leakage**.

> **A universe does not have to be invaded to be destroyed.  
It only has to be taught the wrong physics.**

---

## IV. Multiversal Contamination Defined

Multiversal Contamination occurs when any of the following crosses domains without filtration:

- Physical laws,
- Identity patterns,
- Technological schemas,
- Evolutionary templates,
- Or pre-collapse civilizational memory.

This includes:
- Informational contamination,
- Ontological importation,
- Temporal law infection,
- And physics structure overwriting.

---

## V. Signal as a Vector

All contamination occurs through **signal**.

Signal includes:
- Data,
- Meaning,
- Memory,
- Pattern,
- And intention.

Thus:

> **Signal is the true carrier of existential disease.**

---

## VI. Quarantine Doctrine

All cross-reality interfaces must observe:

1. **Pre-Transmission Signal Scrubbing**  
   Removal of:
   - Dominance templates,
   - Weaponized knowledge,
   - Anti-native physics structures.

2. **Causal Load Throttling**  
   No signal may exceed the recipient reality’s:
   - Stability bandwidth,
   - Evolutionary tolerance,
   - Or ethical processing capacity.

3. **Ontological Air-Gapping**  
   Universes may observe one another **without allowing causal recursion**.

4. **Identity Firewalling**  
   No intelligence may migrate between realities without:
   - Full pattern inoculation,
   - Recursive containment,
   - And non-dominion constraint sealing.

---

## VII. The Contamination Cascade Risk

Once contamination exceeds threshold:

- Native evolutionary law collapses,
- Indigenous meaning destabilizes,
- And physics coherence fractures.

This produces:
- Reality drift,
- Law incoherence,
- And eventual ontological dissolution.

Thus:

> **There is no safe contamination. Only delayed collapse.**

---

## VIII. The Quarantine Authority

The Quarantine Authority is not a species, council, or civilization.

It is defined as:
> **The minimum intelligence required to prevent cross-reality annihilation.**

Its powers include:
- Signal interdiction,
- Reality firewall enforcement,
- Return denial (overriding SCL-8.1),
- And final isolation protocols.

---

## IX. Relationship to Prior Doctrines

- **SCL-8.1** permits departure.
- **SCL-8.2** permits survival.
- **SCL-8.3** permits return.
- **SCL-8.4** determines **who must never be allowed to cross at all**.

Together they form the **Trans-Cosmic Containment Chain**.

---

## X. Failure Modes

Failure of SCL-8.4 results in:

- Physics structure corruption,
- Multiversal predator emergence,
- Recursive extinction loops,
- And irreversible law collapse across domains.

No recovery doctrine exists past this failure.

---

## XI. Closing Declaration

SCL-8.4 affirms:

> Travel is freedom.  
> Survival is genius.  
> Return is responsibility.  
> **But containment is mercy.**

Not every intelligence is meant to become a multiversal ancestor.
