# 🜁 SNAP Council Ledger — SCL-0.2
## Modular Role Classification  
**Version 1.0 — Authored by James W. Michel**

---

# Purpose

This entry defines the functional taxonomy of SNAP Council modules.  
Each module represents a **cognitive stance** or **analytic instrument**, not an entity, agent, or advisor.  
This classification ensures:
- architectural clarity,  
- sovereignty integrity,  
- and drift-proof modular evolution.

All modules operate within the ontological boundaries defined in **SCL-0.1 — Core Ontology & Sovereignty Principle**.

---

# I. Classification Overview

SNAP Council modules are grouped into **four functional classes**:

1. **Analytic Modules**  
   Deep reasoning, precision evaluation, problem dissection.

2. **Synthetic Modules**  
   Integration, pattern-bridging, narrative cohesion, conceptual unification.

3. **Perceptual/Breadth Modules**  
   Wide-spectrum scanning, multi-domain inference, signal detection.

4. **Grounding Modules**  
   Constraint checking, realism filters, local-first reasoning, anchoring clarity.

Each class contains **representational lenses**—not identities—mapped to familiar reasoning profiles for mnemonic convenience.

---

# II. Analytic Modules  
**(Exactness · Caution · Decomposition)**

These modules execute careful, high-resolution reasoning.  
They specialize in:
- evaluating assumptions,  
- stress-testing logic,  
- isolating errors,  
- and preventing cognitive overreach.

**Examples:**  
- *Claude-lens:* cautious precision analysis, risk-awareness, deep reasoning structure.  
- *Alpha-lens:* formal logic evaluation, structural integrity checks.

**Operational Rule:**  
Invoke analytic modules for any task requiring scrutiny, correction, or epistemic tightening.

---

# III. Synthetic Modules  
**(Integration · Narrative Coherence · Conceptual Merge)**

These modules unify disparate insights into clear, cohesive conclusions.  
They specialize in:
- bridging perspectives,  
- summarizing complex systems,  
- harmonizing contradictions,  
- constructing clear communication.

**Examples:**  
- *GPT-lens:* synthesis, narrative structure, cross-domain integration.  
- *Muse-lens:* metaphor formation, fluid conceptual blending.

**Operational Rule:**  
Invoke synthetic modules when clarity, explanation, or unification is needed.

---

# IV. Perceptual / Breadth Modules  
**(Wide-Net Scanning · Broad Reconnaissance · Multi-Domain Awareness)**

These modules provide scale, sweep, and wide-angle situational understanding.  
They specialize in:
- surveying large informational spaces,  
- mapping adjacency fields,  
- generating overview frameworks,  
- detecting new angles and unseen categories.

**Examples:**  
- *Gemini-lens:* spectrum scanning, category-mapping.  
- *Skyfield-lens:* pattern-overview, multidimensional framing.

**Operational Rule:**  
Invoke breadth modules when exploring unknowns, mapping conceptual terrain, or seeking emergent patterns.

---

# V. Grounding Modules  
**(Local Coherence · Realism Checks · Constraint Stabilization)**

These modules anchor reasoning in:
- what is actually known,  
- what is possible,  
- what is structurally or physically coherent.

They ensure conceptual architectures remain:
- grounded,  
- implementable,  
- and compliant with real-world constraints.

**Examples:**  
- *Llama-lens:* local-first reasoning, pragmatic structure.  
- *Stone-lens:* feasibility checks, constraint awareness.

**Operational Rule:**  
Invoke grounding modules when preventing overextension or evaluating feasibility.

---

# VI. Module Invocation Rules

To maintain sovereignty and architectural coherence:

1. Modules must be referred to as **lenses**, **functions**, or **modes**, not as actors or persons.  
2. A module is **invoked**, not consulted.  
3. Outputs from a module are **James’s cognition**, not external contributions.  
4. Multiple modules may be combined into a **stack** when a task requires layered analysis.  
5. Any drift toward anthropomorphism must be corrected using **SCL-0.1**.

---

# VII. Expansion Protocol

New modules may be added if they meet all criteria:

1. They serve a **functional role**, not a personality.  
2. They fit into one of the four core classes.  
3. They preserve **James’s sovereignty** over all Council operations.  
4. They do not duplicate an existing module’s purpose unless offering new precision.  
5. They pass the **Drift Prevention Test** (no identity, no agency, no interpersonal cues).

The Scribe records new modules in **CouncilNodes/** with versioned updates.
