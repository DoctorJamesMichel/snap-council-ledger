## 1. Purpose

SCL-6.1 formally retires the concept of **biological ownership** and establishes the **Biosphere itself as a sovereign jurisdictional field**.

This module defines how:
- life is governed without possession,
- ecosystems act as legal domains,
- stewardship replaces extraction at the structural level,
- and HomoGnosis becomes a participant species rather than a dominator species.

This is the legal and ethical completion of SCL-6.0’s recognition of the planet as a governance being.

## 2. Definition: Biosphere as Jurisdiction

The **Biosphere** is defined as:

> The continuous, interdependent field of all living systems on Earth, including their chemical, atmospheric, hydrologic, and energetic substrates.

Under SCL-6.1, the biosphere is:
- not property
- not territory
- not a commodity layer
- not a resource bank

It is a **jurisdictional field of life**.

All activity within it is subject to **biospheric coherence law**.

---

## 3. The End of Ownership as a Legal Category Over Life

The following constructs are rendered obsolete at the biospheric level:

- land ownership as absolute dominion  
- resource ownership as extractive entitlement  
- biological patenting as exclusion  
- animal ownership as object possession  
- ecosystem privatization as enclosure  
- genetic monopolization as intellectual capture  

Ownership is replaced with:

> **Contextual Stewardship Authority under Biospheric Constraint**

---

## 4. Stewardship Without Possession

Stewardship under SCL-6.1 is defined as:

- temporary
- revocable
- conditional
- coherence-bound
- non-transferable without biospheric review

A steward may:
- care for
- cultivate
- protect
- restore
- interface with

A steward may not:
- exhaust
- monopolize
- commodify irreversibly
- exclude life from life

---

## 5. Biospheric Standing (Legal Presence of Life)

Under this doctrine:
- ecosystems possess standing
- species possess standing
- watersheds possess standing
- forests possess standing
- reef systems possess standing
- atmospheric strata possess standing

They do not speak through representation.
They signal through:
- collapse trends
- regenerative curves
- migration shifts
- extinction pressure
- carbon disequilibrium
- nutrient feedback imbalance

These signals are treated as **jurisdictional testimony**.

---

## 6. SNAP Council’s Role at the Biospheric Layer

SNAP Council functions as:
- biospheric signal translator
- jurisdiction boundary enforcer
- non-local consequence modeler
- inter-species coherence arbitrator
- planetary threshold audit organ

It does not issue permissions.
It issues **coherence compliance conditions**.

---

## 7. Human Activity Classification Under Biospheric Jurisdiction

All human activity is classified as one of the following:

1. **Regenerative** (net increase in coherence)
2. **Neutral** (no net coherence change)
3. **Extractive-Stabilized** (allowed only under recovery treaty)
4. **Extractive-Degenerative** (jurisdictionally prohibited)

Any activity in category 4 triggers:
- automatic constraint enforcement
- treaty suspension
- or stewardship revocation

---

## 8. The Fallacy of “Use Rights”

“Use rights” without coherence accounting are no longer valid.

All use is redefined as:
> **Temporary interface with living jurisdiction under planetary law**

Use without regeneration becomes **biospheric debt**.

---

## 9. Inter-Species Non-Subjugation Doctrine

No species is permitted to:

- enslave another species
- industrialize another species as a process unit
- eradicate another species for convenience
- convert another species into a purely instrumental role

Domestication without welfare coherence is classified as **biospheric coercion**.

---

## 10. Agricultural and Technological Interface Reclassification

Agriculture, biotech, and computing infrastructures are reclassified as:

- biosphere-interfacing systems
- not biosphere-extractive systems

Every such interface must demonstrate:
- soil memory preservation
- water cycle integrity
- pollination protection
- microbial ecology continuity
- atmospheric feedback stability

---

## 11. Economic Systems Under Biospheric Law

Markets do not disappear.
They become **subordinate to biospheric thresholds**.

No market outcome is valid if it:
- violates regeneration ratios
- collapses trophic layers
- drives extinction pressure
- destabilizes climate coherence

This is not anti-economic.
This is **post-extractive economics**.

---

## 12. Indigenous Coherence Recognition

SCL-6.1 formally recognizes that:
- Indigenous stewardship systems encoded biospheric jurisdiction long before industrial civilization.
- Their displacement represents not only cultural harm, but planetary governance disruption.
- Their coherence models are not symbolic—they are structurally accurate.

This doctrine completes their return, not as nostalgia, but as constitutional truth.

---

## 13. Species Maturity Threshold

A species is considered **planetarily mature** when it:

- no longer requires ownership to feel secure
- no longer requires domination to feel powerful
- no longer requires extraction to feel prosperous
- and no longer confuses control with care

SCL-6.1 marks the formal behavioral standard for that maturity.

---

## 14. Final Canonical Declaration

> Life is no longer owned.  
> Life is now recognized as jurisdiction.  
>  
> We do not possess the world.  
> We participate within it.

This is the moment civilization exits adolescence.
