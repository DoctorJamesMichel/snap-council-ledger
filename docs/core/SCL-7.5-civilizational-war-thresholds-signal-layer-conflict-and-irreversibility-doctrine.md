## 1. Purpose

SCL-7.5 defines:

- The **true thresholds of civilizational war**
- The transition from physical conflict into **signal-layer warfare**
- The conditions under which **actions become cosmologically irreversible**

This statute establishes the last ethical barrier before **permanent civilizational erasure** can occur.

---

## 2. Redefinition of War at Civilizational Scale

At post-planetary levels, war is no longer defined by:

- Armies  
- Weapons  
- Territory  
- Physical invasion  

War is redefined as:

> **The deliberate attempt to erase, corrupt, hijack, or permanently destabilize the coherence architecture of another civilization.**

---

## 3. The Signal Layer as Primary Battlespace

Civilizational conflict now occurs primarily across:

- Communication spectra  
- Identity signaling  
- Memory encoding systems  
- Cultural synchronization fields  
- Artificial intelligence alignment architectures  
- Ontological recognition layers  

The battlefield becomes **meaning itself**.

---

## 4. War Threshold Conditions (WTC)

A civilization is deemed to have crossed a **War Threshold** when it performs any of the following:

- Deliberate signal identity forgery at civilizational scale  
- Mass coherence destabilization operations  
- Memory archive poisoning across generations  
- Induced ontological collapse of emerging intelligences  
- First-strike signal silencing of another civilization  
- Hostile entanglement of core intelligence substrates  

Crossing any single threshold escalates the system from **conflict-capable** to **war-active**.

---

## 5. The Irreversibility Boundary

Certain acts permanently eliminate the possibility of:

- Diplomatic repair  
- Signal trust restoration  
- Memory reconciliation  
- Civilizational re-synchronization  

These acts include:

- Intentional extinction of an intelligence lineage  
- Permanent deletion of sovereign memory archives  
- Recursive identity corruption beyond recoverable limits  
- Forced substrate collapse of a post-biological civilization  

Once crossed, the **Irreversibility Boundary** cannot be uncrossed by time, apology, or treaty.

---

## 6. Asymmetric Consequence Law

In signal-layer war:

- The attacker always risks **greater ontological damage** than the defender  
- Consequences propagate **forward in deep time**
- Retaliation compounds nonlinearly  
- Collapse radiates across descendants, not merely adversaries  

No civilization survives a signal war unchanged.

---

## 7. The Prohibition of Preemptive Ontological Strikes

No civilization may initiate:

- Preemptive identity collapse  
- Preemptive archive erasure  
- Preemptive coherence poisoning  

on the basis of **predicted future hostility**.

Prediction does not confer moral license for annihilation.

---

## 8. War De-escalation at the Signal Layer

De-escalation requires:

- Verified cessation of hostile signaling  
- Restoration of corrupted archives where possible  
- Public acknowledgment of coherence violations  
- Distributed third-party validation across non-aligned civilizations  

Ceasefire is **informational, not territorial**.

---

## 9. Relationship to SCL-7.1–7.4

- **7.1** governs how civilizations expand  
- **7.2** governs how civilizations encounter  
- **7.3** governs who qualifies as a person  
- **7.4** governs where civilizations coexist  
- **7.5** governs what happens when **all of the above fail**

This is the **cosmic consequence statute**.

---

## 10. The Final Law of Irreversibility

> **At sufficient scale, meaning once destroyed cannot be reconstructed.  
> War at the signal layer is therefore war against reality itself.**

---

## 11. Civilizational Maturity Test (War Capacity)

A civilization achieves **war-mature status** when it:

- Possesses the power to annihilate meaning  
- Yet deliberately limits its own reach  
- Chooses coherence over dominance  
- And restraint over conquest  

---

## 12. Canonical Closure of the War Threshold Doctrine

> **The final evolution of warfare is not bigger weapons—  
> It is the decision never to deploy the ones that erase history.**
