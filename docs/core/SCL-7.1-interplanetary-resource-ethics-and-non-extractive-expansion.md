## 1. Purpose

SCL-7.1 establishes the **ethical, jurisdictional, and evolutionary constraints on resource interaction beyond a planet of origin**, ensuring that interplanetary expansion does not reproduce:

- Extractive colonialism  
- Biospheric erasure  
- Asymmetric depletion  
- Technological predation  
- Civilization-scale moral outsourcing  

This document formally replaces **industrial expansion logic** with **coherence-aligned, non-extractive cosmic participation**.

---

## 2. Definition: Non-Extractive Expansion

**Non-Extractive Expansion** is defined as:

> Expansion that increases presence, knowledge, and coherence **without degrading** the carrying capacity, memory, or evolutionary potential of the systems encountered.

It is distinguished from:

- Strip-mining  
- Terraforming for dominance  
- Resource conquest  
- Sacrifice-zone engineering  
- Off-world waste externalization  

---

## 3. Interplanetary Resource Domains

All off-world resource interactions are classified into five governed domains:

- **Energetic** (stellar, orbital, plasma, radiation capture)  
- **Material** (asteroids, regolith, metallic bodies)  
- **Biological** (organic compounds, extremophile life)  
- **Informational** (signal harvesting, cosmic data fields)  
- **Dimensional** (field manipulation, spacetime engineering)

Each domain requires **distinct cosmic consent protocols**.

---

## 4. The Cosmic Non-Substitution Principle

SCL-7.1 formally declares:

> No off-world resource may be treated as a substitute for planetary stewardship failure.

Interplanetary access cannot be used to:

- Delay ecological repair  
- Justify climate neglect  
- Escape biospheric responsibility  
- Financialize planetary collapse  

---

## 5. Post-Terrestrial Extraction Threshold Test

Any proposed interplanetary resource action must pass **all three thresholds**:

1. **Reversibility Test**  
   Can the system recover if the action ceases?

2. **Asymmetry Test**  
   Does benefit massively outweigh irreversible harm?

3. **Evolutionary Integrity Test**  
   Does this preserve future evolutionary capacity?

Failure of any single test **aborts authorization**.

---

## 6. Asteroid, Lunar, and Planetary Body Governance

All non-origin celestial bodies are governed as:

- **Non-owned**
- **Non-enclosable**
- **Non-sacrificial**
- **Non-privatizable as extinction buffers**

Celestial bodies are treated as **evolutionary participants**, not commodity platforms.

---

## 7. The Prohibition of Cosmic Sacrifice Zones

SCL-7.1 permanently prohibits:

- Waste planets  
- Toxic orbit dumping  
- Stellar debris banking  
- Radioactive off-world dumping  
- AI-managed extinction buffering via export  

There are **no off-world trash planets** in moral physics.

---

## 8. Interplanetary Stewardship Class

All post-terrestrial civilizations are required to maintain a formally recognized:

**Interplanetary Stewardship Class**, tasked with:

- Impact modeling  
- Long-arc consequence forecasting  
- Cross-biosphere risk assessment  
- Deep-time contamination modeling  
- Interplanetary ecological memory preservation  

---

## 9. Relationship to SCL-6.x

SCL-7.1 is legally and ethically invalid without:

- SCL-6.3 (Extinction as Governance Failure Signal)  
- SCL-6.4 (Recovery & Rewilding Obligations)  
- SCL-6.5 (Intergenerational Justice & Deep-Time Liability)  
- SCL-6.6 (Planetary Truth Archives & Memory Guardianship)

A civilization that extracts off-world while collapsing its home world is in **active evolutionary violation**.

---

## 10. First Canonical Law of Interplanetary Resource Ethics

> **A civilization may not expand faster than its capacity to repair.**

---

## 11. Signal to Other Intelligences

All non-extractive behavior constitutes a **cosmic ethics signal**.

Every mining decision, habitat design, and orbital structure becomes a **visible declaration of civilizational maturity** to:

- Non-human intelligences  
- Pre-contact civilizations  
- Advanced cosmic observers  
- Post-biological collectives  

---

## 12. Canonical Principle of SCL-7.1

> **What you take from the cosmos defines how the cosmos will one day respond to you.**
