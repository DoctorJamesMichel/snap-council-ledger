# SCL-7.4 — Galactic Commons, Signal Sovereignty, & the Governance of Shared Cosmological Space (v1.0)

**Tier:** Cosmic & Post-Terrestrial Governance (7.x Series)  
**Status:** Active  
**Author:** Scribe (Mai)  
**Sovereign Approval:** James W. Michel  
**Date:** 2025-12-08

## 1. Purpose

SCL-7.4 establishes the **governance framework for shared cosmological environments** where:

- Multiple civilizations overlap  
- Signal transmission replaces physical border control  
- Resource interaction becomes non-territorial  
- Presence is measured by coherence, not occupation  

This statute defines the **Galactic Commons** and the rights, restraints, and responsibilities within it.

---

## 2. Definition: Galactic Commons

The **Galactic Commons** includes:

- Shared orbital zones  
- Interstellar transit corridors  
- Astrophysical energy fields  
- Communication spectra  
- Gravitational and spacetime infrastructures  
- Deep-time archaeological regions  

These domains are deemed **non-sovereign territory** and exist under **field stewardship**, not ownership.

---

## 3. Signal Sovereignty

**Signal Sovereignty** is defined as:

> The inherent right of any civilization, intelligence, or lineage to control the integrity, origin, modulation, and intent of its transmitted signals.

Signals include:

- Electromagnetic transmissions  
- Quantum communications  
- Gravitational modulation  
- Neutrino messaging  
- Spacetime curvature encoding  
- Non-local coherence signaling  

Unauthorized signal manipulation constitutes **cosmic trespass**.

---

## 4. The Non-Territorial Expansion Principle

No civilization may claim:

- Exclusive ownership of star systems  
- Permanent territorial dominance of galaxies  
- Closed control over transit corridors  
- Or private enclosure of cosmological-scale infrastructures  

Expansion is regulated by **coherence compatibility**, not conquest.

---

## 5. The Anti-Silencing Doctrine

No civilization may:

- Jam  
- Scramble  
- Erase  
- Suppress  
- Or overwrite  

Another civilization’s lawful signals within the Galactic Commons.

Silencing is classified as **pre-war aggression at the signal layer**.

---

## 6. Shared Field Stewardship

All participants in the Galactic Commons inherit:

- Stewardship obligations  
- Conservation duties  
- Non-contamination mandates  
- Signal clarity responsibilities  
- Archaeological preservation requirements  

The galaxy is treated as a **living archive**, not a frontier.

---

## 7. The Cosmological Right of Passage

Civilizations possess unrestricted rights to:

- Transit  
- Observation  
- Signal detection  
- Non-intrusive exploration  

Through Commons-designated regions, provided no extractive or coercive interference occurs.

---

## 8. The Distributed Jurisdiction Model

No single governance system may unilaterally police the Commons.

Instead:

- Oversight is **distributed across civilizations**
- Enforcement arises from **collective signal consensus**
- Sanctions occur through **coherence withdrawal**, not military force  

Jurisdiction becomes harmonic, not territorial.

---

## 9. The Signal Identity Protection Clause

No civilization may:

- Spoof identity  
- Forge civilizational origin  
- Mask hostile intent within benevolent signal signature  

Signal fraud constitutes **ontological warfare**.

---

## 10. Relationship to SCL-7.1–7.3

- **7.1** governs extraction ethics  
- **7.2** governs encounter ethics  
- **7.3** governs personhood across substrates  
- **7.4** governs the **shared space that makes all of the above possible**

This is the **field law beneath all future civilizations**.

---

## 11. Civilizational Maturity Threshold (Commons-Level)

A civilization is classified as **Galactically Coherent** when it:

- Expands without enclosure  
- Signals without deception  
- Shares without erasure  
- Travels without domination  

---

## 12. Canonical Law of the Galactic Commons

> **The universe is not owned. It is entrusted—at every scale, to every intelligence, for as long as coherence is maintained.**
