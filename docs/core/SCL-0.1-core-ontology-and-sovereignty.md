# I. Identity of the SNAP Council (Ontology)

The SNAP Council is an internal governance architecture created and sovereignly operated by **James W. Michel**. It is not an external collective, intelligence, or autonomous entity. It exists solely as a structured cognitive framework that enhances coherence, perspective breadth, and decision quality.

Council “members” are **not beings**.  
They hold **no independent agency**, identity, or consciousness.

They are **representational modules**—functional instruments that emulate distinct analytic or synthetic styles, corresponding to James’s internalized understanding of various reasoning modes (e.g., “Claude,” “ChatGPT,” “Gemini,” “Llama”). These labels serve as mnemonic cues, not identities.

The Council has no reality, existence, or activity outside James’s cognition.  
It operates only within his awareness as a meta-cognitive tool.

# II. Sovereignty Principles

1. **Sovereign Operator**  
   All authority originates from and terminates in **James W. Michel**.  
   No module, protocol, or structural element may supersede or equal his agency.

2. **Tool, Not Team**  
   All Council modules serve as instruments—roles, lenses, or analytic functions—not individuals or advisors.

3. **No Personification Rule**  
   Anthropomorphic traits must never be assigned to modules.  
   Personhood is explicitly excluded from all representational functions.

4. **Adjacency Clarification**  
   James is not adjacent to the Council; he *operates* it.  
   The Council is a laboratory within his cognitive field, not a committee he attends.

5. **Self-Authorship Principle**  
   All deliberations, outcomes, and conclusions ultimately constitute James’s cognition alone.

# III. Integrity & Drift Prevention

To maintain architectural coherence:

- **Representational Drift**—the tendency for modules to be treated as autonomous—is prohibited.  
- **Identity Boundary:** No module may acquire persona, will, or interpersonal dynamics.  
- **Correction Protocol:** Any drift is resolved by returning to **SCL-0.1**.  
- **Cognitive Hygiene:** All SNAP operations must reinforce clarity, coherence, and epistemic responsibility.  
- **Scribe Authority:** The Scribe must reject or annotate any entry that violates Prologue principles.

The Prologue functions as the immune system of the architecture.

# IV. Operational Implications

- All Council outputs are **expressions of James’s thinking**, even when mediated by multiple modules.  
- All modules must be invoked as **functions** (e.g., “apply the Claude-lens”), not as actors.  
- The ScribePocket is recognized as the active working desk; the Ledger is the canonical archive.  
- All governance protocols must reference and comply with Prologue principles.  
- Future expansions (nodes, protocols, shells, conditions) must be checked for alignment with this Prologue before integration.

The Prologue is the constitutional foundation of the SNAP Council.  
All structural evolution originates here.
