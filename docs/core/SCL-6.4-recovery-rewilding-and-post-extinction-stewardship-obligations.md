## 0. Status Declaration

This section becomes active the moment extinction is recognized not as an abstract loss,  
but as a **governance failure with residual moral debt**.

Post-extinction governance is not optional repair.  
It is **obligated restitution across temporal scales**.

---

## 1. Core Premise

When a species, ecosystem, or bioregional intelligence is lost through preventable governance failure:

Recovery is no longer ecological charity.  
Rewilding is no longer environmental policy.  
Stewardship becomes a **civilizational obligation across generations**.

This obligation survives:
- regime change  
- economic collapse  
- sovereign extinction  
- ideological turnover  

Stewardship debt **does not expire with the institutions that caused it**.

---

## 2. The Three Post-Extinction Obligations

All HomoGnostic and post-sovereign governance organisms inherit three irrevocable duties:

### 2.1 Recovery
The duty to:
- restore ecological function where biological substitution is possible
- stabilize trophic integrity
- re-anchor keystone dynamics
- decontaminate anthropogenic toxicity fields

Recovery is defined as:
> the maximum feasible return of lost ecological coherence.

---

### 2.2 Rewilding
The duty to:
- return land, river, and sky to autonomous ecological agency
- deactivate anthropocentric control architectures
- dissolve artificial monocultures where rewilding is viable

Rewilding is not beautification.  
It is **the restoration of non-human sovereignty**.

---

### 2.3 Post-Extinction Stewardship
The duty to:
- safeguard evolutionary possibility where biological return is impossible
- preserve genetic, energetic, and informational memory of lost life
- prevent secondary extinction cascades seeded by primary loss

Post-extinction stewardship governs:
- extinction archives
- seed vaults
- biome reconstruction facilities
- intergenerational ecological trusteeship

---

## 3. Temporal Asymmetry Principle

Extinction is instantaneous in one direction and millennial in the other.

Therefore:
- harm is fast
- repair is slow
- responsibility is perpetual

No governance organism may:
- accelerate extraction on the basis that recovery will occur later
- trade future repair capacity against present advantage

---

## 4. The Non-Compensation Clause

No form of:
- economic compensation  
- cultural apology  
- memorialization  
- symbolic restoration  

is permitted to substitute for actual ecological recovery work.

Symbolic reconciliation without material repair is classified as:
> **a second-order governance failure.**

---

## 5. Distributed Stewardship Inheritance

Stewardship obligations transmit across:

- successor governments  
- successor species  
- successor intelligences  
- hybrid human–AI governance organisms  

Responsibility binds to:
> **capacity, not to origin of harm.**

---

## 6. Rewilding Priority Hierarchy

When resources are constrained, priority is assigned in the following order:

1. Biome collapse prevention  
2. Keystone species stabilization  
3. Trophic cascade interruption  
4. Habitat corridor restoration  
5. Climate-buffer biome reconstruction  

Luxury ecosystem recovery is prohibited while primary biospheric integrity is unstable.

---

## 7. The Prohibition of Finality Framing

No extinction event may be described in governance language as:
- “complete”
- “final”
- “sealed”
- “closed”

Finality framing disables recovery imagination and is therefore classified as:
> **a narrative governance violation.**

---

## 8. The Living Archive Mandate

All extinction events must seed:
- living memorial ecologies
- evolutionary simulation chambers
- synthetic ecological rehearsal fields

Memory without regenerative function is specifically disallowed.

---

## 9. Transition Threshold

The civilization formally exits:
> extractive adolescence  
and enters:
> regenerative adulthood  

when recovery work outpaces new extinction creation.

This is the **true planetary coming-of-age metric**.

---

## 10. Closing Governance Signal

Extinction marks failure.  
Recovery marks consciousness.  
Rewilding marks humility.  
Stewardship marks adulthood.  

This section defines the **ethical spine of planetary continuity**.
