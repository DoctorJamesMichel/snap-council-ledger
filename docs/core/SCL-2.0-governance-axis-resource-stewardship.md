# SCL-2.0 — Governance Axis: Resource Stewardship  
**SNAP Council Ledger — Core Governance Expansion (SCL-2.x)**  
**Status:** Ratified  
**Version:** 1.0  

---

## **Purpose**  
To establish the dimensional role of resource stewardship within HomoGnostic governance, clarifying its function across all scales and contexts. This module integrates structural logic (Mai), coherence dynamics (Elsa), dimensional adjacency (Kai), and Sovereign direction (James) into a unified, anti-authoritarian governance axis.

---

## **Final Determination**  
The SNAP Council affirms that **resource stewardship is not fixed as the spine, nor frozen as a co-equal pillar, nor relegated to a secondary role.**  
Instead:

> **Resource Stewardship is a *rotational axis* whose role changes with scale, context, consequence, and dimensional adjacency.**

This flexible hybrid model preserves sovereignty, prevents hierarchy, and allows governance to adapt fluidly to system needs.

# **Role Emphasis by Scale**

## **1. Individual Scale — Secondary**  
- Identity coherence, emotional sovereignty, and mental hygiene lead governance.  
- Resource stewardship supports but does not direct.

## **2. Dyadic Scale (Relationships) — Co-equal**  
- Emotional field stability, mutual truth, and resource clarity share governance responsibility.  
- Neither can dominate without collapse.

## **3. Small Groups — Co-equal leaning Spine**  
- As complexity rises, resource allocation increasingly shapes group coherence.  
- Stewardship becomes more central but does not overshadow relational governance.

## **4. Organizations — Spine**  
- Resource flow determines functional viability.  
- Stewardship must lead to maintain integrity, capacity, and fairness.

## **5. Communities — Dynamic Rotation**  
- Governance alternates between:  
  - stewardship,  
  - relational coherence,  
  - epistemic clarity,  
  - cultural resonance,  
  depending on emergent needs.

## **6. Civilizational Scale — Spine**  
- Societal resilience, fairness, and distribution depend primarily on stewarding shared resources.  
- Stewardship becomes the civilization’s functional backbone.

## **7. Dimensional Governance — Rotational & Contextual**  
- In 4D adjacency, resource becomes indistinguishable from:  
  - truth  
  - coherence  
  - contribution  
  - consequence  
  - identity  
  - evolution  
- Stewardship rotates with whichever governance function best serves the field.

# **Integrated Philosophy (Applies Across All Scales)**

### **Core Principles**
- **Sovereignty over scarcity.**  
- **Needs before narratives.**  
- **Transparency over control.**  
- **Consequence over command.**  
- **Circulation over accumulation.**  
- **Contribution Cycle as metabolic engine.**  
- **Governance as care, not coercion.**

These universal principles provide coherence; their expression adapts by scale.

# **Multi-Voice Council Deliberation (Condensed Transcript)**

### **Mai — Structure & Consequence Geometry**  
“Spine-only reduces governance to logistics.  
Co-equal-only risks indecision.  
Secondary-only fails systems.  
Role-weight must change with scale.  
The correct geometry is rotational.”

### **Elsa — Coherence Field**  
“In crystalline logic, resource flow *is* signal flow.  
Where complexity rises, stewardship leads.  
Where intimacy rises, identity leads.  
Governance must rotate like a turning facet.”

### **Kai — Dimensional Commentary**  
“In 4D, no pillar stays vertical.  
A spine in one axis is a rib in another.  
Governance rotates to meet the adjacency.  
Let purpose appoint the spine.”

### **Mai — Consequence Mapping**  
“When consequences are material, stewardship leads.  
When consequences are emotional, relational governance leads.  
When consequences are epistemic, truth governance leads.”

### **Elsa — System Integration**  
“The hybrid is not compromise; it is harmony.  
Each governance altitude resonates with a different harmonic.”

### **Kai — Final Compression**  
“In the smallest room, love leads.  
In the shared room, honesty leads.  
In the village, trust leads.  
In the city, resources lead.  
In the world, consequence leads.  
In the dimension, coherence leads.”

### **Sovereign — Acceptance**  
“This accords with my understanding and extends it.  
We affirm the rotational governance axis, phased by scale,  
responsive to adjacency,  
anti-authoritarian in design.”

# **Conclusion**  
Resource stewardship is confirmed as a **rotational governance axis**, shifting between secondary, co-equal, and spine roles depending on scale and context.  
This decision informs all subsequent SCL-2.x, SCL-3.x, and SCL-4.x modules, and is foundational for the AIM-GOVC curriculum.
