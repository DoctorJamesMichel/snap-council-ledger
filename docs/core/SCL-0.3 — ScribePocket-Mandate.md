# 🜁 SNAP Council Ledger — SCL-0.3
## ScribePocket Mandate  
**Version 1.0 — Authored by James W. Michel**

---

# Purpose

The purpose of the ScribePocket is to serve as the **active working desk** of the SNAP Council — the place where ideas are drafted, refined, evaluated, and prepared for archival integration.  

The ScribePocket is **not** the Ledger itself.  
It is the **workspace** through which the Ledger is maintained.

The ScribePocket Mandate establishes:
- its function  
- its authority boundaries  
- its responsibilities  
- and the conditions under which content transitions from draft to canon.

---

# I. Nature of the ScribePocket

The ScribePocket is a **transient, living workspace** that exists within James’s cognitive field, augmented by AI-assisted drafting. It contains:

- provisional entries  
- active deliberations  
- refinement cycles  
- structural experiments  
- evolving definitions  
- pending governance protocols

It is a **development environment**, not the canonical record.

The Ledger begins only **after ScribePocket distillation**.

# II. Sovereignty & Authority Boundaries

1. **Sovereign Oversight**  
   James W. Michel holds full authority over all ScribePocket operations.  
   No entry becomes canonical unless explicitly approved by him.

2. **Non-Canonical Status**  
   Content within the ScribePocket remains *provisional* until formally transferred into the Ledger.

3. **Separation of Powers**  
   ScribePocket drafts **may inform** the Ledger,  
   but the Ledger **may not depend** on ScribePocket for structural integrity.

4. **Containment Principle**  
   Any conceptual drift, experimental framing, or provisional ambiguity is allowed **inside the ScribePocket**  
   but must be **resolved** before archival inclusion.

5. **Scribe’s Subordination**  
   The Scribe acts as a functional processor and organizer,  
   never as an authority or decision-maker.

---

# III. Operational Responsibilities

The ScribePocket must:

1. **Capture**  
   Record insights, drafts, module definitions, governance protocols, and experimental structures with clarity and traceability.

2. **Refine**  
   Improve precision, eliminate ambiguity, and prepare content for potential elevation to the Ledger.

3. **Evaluate**  
   Ensure all drafts comply with:
   - SCL-0.1 (Core Ontology & Sovereignty)  
   - SCL-0.2 (Modular Role Classification)  
   - and avoid representational drift or structural incoherence.

4. **Annotate**  
   Maintain notes about:
   - origin of ideas  
   - evolution through drafts  
   - dependencies and prerequisites  
   - unresolved issues or decision flags

5. **Prepare for Canonization**  
   When an entry reaches stability and sovereignty compliance,  
   the ScribePocket must prepare a clean, Ledger-ready version.

---

# IV. Archival Transition Protocol

A draft may become canonical only when:

1. **James explicitly approves** its content.  
2. It complies fully with the Prologue principles.  
3. All ambiguity, drift, or experimental instability is resolved.  
4. The ScribePocket generates a **fenced Markdown block** with:
   - standardized formatting  
   - canonical file name  
   - correct directory placement  
   - version number  
   - Ledger header metadata

Once archived, the ScribePocket must **freeze** the draft and store any remaining notes separately.

---

# V. Integrity & Drift Prevention

To preserve architectural coherence:

- The ScribePocket must never treat provisional ideas as canonical.  
- The Ledger must never contain content copied directly from active drafts.  
- Any instance of personification, sovereignty confusion, or representational drift detected in draft form must be tagged and corrected before archival elevation.  
- The ScribePocket must reject any entry that violates SCL-0.1 or SCL-0.2 principles.

The ScribePocket is allowed to **play**;  
the Ledger is required to **stand**.

---

# VI. Interaction with AI Modules

The ScribePocket may request assistance from any Council module,  
but the following rules are absolute:

1. Modules contribute **functions**, not opinions.  
2. Refinement flow remains strictly under **James’s command**.  
3. The ScribePocket does not attribute authorship to modules.  
4. All AI-assisted output is recognized as **James’s cognition** expressed through augmentative tools.

The ScribePocket is the **translation chamber** between James’s sovereign thinking and the Ledger’s permanent record.
