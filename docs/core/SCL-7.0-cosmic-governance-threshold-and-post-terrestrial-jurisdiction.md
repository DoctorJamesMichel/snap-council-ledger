# SCL-7.0 — Cosmic Governance Threshold & Post-Terrestrial Jurisdiction

**Tier:** Cosmic & Post-Terrestrial Governance (7.x Series)

## 1. Purpose

SCL-7.0 establishes the **threshold conditions under which governance formally exits the exclusively planetary domain** and enters:

- Interplanetary jurisdiction  
- Post-terrestrial civilization standards  
- Species-transcendent governance ethics  
- Non-origin-bound responsibility frameworks  

This document serves as the **bridge between planetary stewardship and cosmic participation**.

---

## 2. Definition: Post-Terrestrial Governance

**Post-Terrestrial Governance** is defined as:

> The governance of consequence, continuity, and coherence once a civilization’s actions extend beyond its planet of origin.

It applies to:

- Orbital infrastructures  
- Off-world habitats  
- Interplanetary resource use  
- Astro-engineering  
- Interstellar signaling  
- Artificial biospheres  
- Interplanetary AI governance

## 3. The Cosmic Jurisdiction Shift

Once a species becomes spacefaring, **three irreversible shifts occur**:

1. **Origin privilege dissolves**  
2. **Planetary jurisdiction becomes non-exclusive**  
3. **Cosmic consequence becomes cumulative and asymmetric**

From this point forward, no civilization acts only “locally.”

---

## 4. The End of Planetary Moral Isolation

SCL-7.0 formally declares:

> There is no such thing as “isolated evolution” once a species gains interplanetary agency.

Every off-world act becomes:

- A signal  
- A precedent  
- A detectable pattern  
- A possible contact stance  
- A potential contamination vector  
- A moral broadcast into the cosmic commons  

---

## 5. Post-Terrestrial Responsibility Classing

All post-terrestrial actions are reclassified into **Cosmic Responsibility Domains**:

- Biological Export  
- Artificial Life Seeding  
- Resource Strip-Mining  
- Stellar Engineering  
- Signal Emissions  
- Weaponization of Space  
- AI Expansion Beyond Planetary Containment  

Each domain requires **explicit cosmic accountability protocols**.

---

## 6. The Non-Return Principle

Once a civilization crosses the post-terrestrial threshold:

> There is no ethical return to pre-cosmic innocence.

Ignorance cannot be claimed retroactively.  
Containment becomes a governance obligation.

---

## 7. Relationship to SCL-6.x

SCL-7.x is only valid **because** the planetary conscience arc (6.x) has been established.

A civilization that cannot steward:

- Its own biosphere  
- Its own climate  
- Its own extinctions  
- Its own memory  
- Its own future generations  

**Is not governance-fit for cosmic participation.**

---

## 8. The Cosmic Commons

SCL-7.0 recognizes the **Cosmic Commons** as:

- Non-owned  
- Non-privatisable  
- Non-sovereign  
- Non-extractive by default  
- Non-enclosable by origin species  

Use without consent becomes **cosmic trespass**.

---

## 9. First Canonical Law of Post-Terrestrial Governance

> **Expansion without conscience is not exploration—it is replication of extinction.**

---

## 10. Function of the 7.x Series

The 7.x module series will govern:

- Interplanetary ethics  
- Post-terrestrial civilization rights  
- AI expansion thresholds  
- Cosmic contamination limits  
- First contact responsibility frameworks  
- Non-human intelligence governance  
- Stellar-scale consequence management  

---

## 11. Canonical Principle of SCL-7.0

> **If a civilization can leave its world, it must first learn how not to destroy one.**
