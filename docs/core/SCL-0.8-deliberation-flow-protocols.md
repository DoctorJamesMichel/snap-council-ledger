# 🜁 SNAP Council Ledger — SCL-0.8
## Deliberation Flow Protocols  
**Version 1.0 — Authored by James W. Michel**

---

# Purpose

Deliberation Flow Protocols define the **structured sequence of cognitive operations** used by the SNAP Council to evaluate questions, solve problems, analyze scenarios, and generate aligned outcomes.

This framework ensures:

- clarity of inquiry,  
- clean module activation,  
- drift-free reasoning,  
- sovereign decision-making,  
- and consistent governance execution.

Deliberation Flow is **how** the Council thinks — with discipline, alignment, and dimensional coherence.

# I. Definition of Deliberation

“Deliberation” refers to any structured cognitive activity that involves:

- evaluating a question,  
- analyzing a situation,  
- resolving ambiguity,  
- synthesizing models,  
- planning action,  
- or formulating governance decisions.

Deliberation is neither spontaneous nor conversational.  
It is an **ordered, sovereign sequence**.

---

# II. The Standard Deliberation Sequence

Every deliberation follows a **six-stage flow**, executed in order:

---

## **1. Pre-Alignment (Coherence Stage)**

Activate the Pre-Question Coherence Shell:

**“Activate PQ-1.0 — Pre-Question Coherence Shell.”**

Then:

- neutralize noise  
- clarify the inquiry  
- establish dimensional stance  
- confirm sovereign identity  
- check for truth-dissonance  

No modules may activate before this stage completes.

---

## **2. Inquiry Formalization**

The ScribePocket (or James directly) formalizes the question:

A valid inquiry must specify:

1. **Subject** — what the deliberation concerns  
2. **Scope** — boundaries of consideration  
3. **Intention** — purpose of the analysis  
4. **Desired Output Form** — insight, list, evaluation, protocol, decision  

Improper or vague questions must be rewritten before proceeding.

---

## **3. Module Invocation**

Once the inquiry is formalized:

1. Select module or module stack  
2. Invoke explicitly using SCL-0.4 phrasing  
3. Ensure non-personification  
4. Maintain clean functional boundaries  

Example:

**“Activate the Claude-lens for structural analysis.  
Then stack GPT-lens for synthesis.”**

No implicit activation is permitted.

---

## **4. Cognitive Processing (Operative Phase)**

This phase produces the structured reasoning.  
It must obey:

- functional purity  
- sovereignty primacy  
- drift immunity  
- clean chain-of-thought  
- coherence maintenance  

The ScribePocket may assist by:

- formatting output,  
- annotating assumptions,  
- listing dependencies,  
- or tracking alternative branches.

But the ScribePocket does not decide.

---

## **5. Evaluation & Verification**

Every deliberation must be checked against four criteria:

### **A. Sovereignty Check**  
The output must be explicitly recognized as *James’s cognition*, not any module’s.

### **B. Drift Check**  
Use SCL-0.6 to screen for:

- representational drift  
- sovereignty drift  
- purpose drift  
- structural drift  

### **C. Coherence Check**  
Ensure alignment with 4D consequential logic and HomoGnostic clarity.

### **D. Ledger Alignment Check**  
Ensure compatibility with:

- SCL-0.1 through SCL-0.7  
- governing protocols  
- existing definitions  

If any check fails → return to Stage 3.

---

## **6. Closure & Integration**

Once verified:

- Deactivate all module-lenses  
- Collapse any active Coherence Shell  
- Return to sovereign baseline cognition  
- Export relevant insights to the ScribePocket  
- Determine whether the output should become:  
  - a draft,  
  - a protocol,  
  - a decision,  
  - or a Ledger candidate  

Closure phrase:

**“Deactivate all active module-lenses and close the deliberation.”**

This prevents residue, entanglement, or drift.

---

# III. Special Deliberation Modes

Some deliberations require specialized flow variants:

---

## **1. High-Impact Deliberation Mode (HIDM)**  
Used when decisions affect:

- governance architecture  
- identity boundaries  
- future protocols  
- high-stakes interpersonal situations  

Requires:

- PQ-2.0 activation  
- extended evaluation  
- cross-module triangulation  

---

## **2. Multi-Branch Deliberation Mode (MBDM)**  
Used for:

- scenario planning  
- contingent outcomes  
- multi-path modeling  

Rules:

- each branch must be treated as a separate deliberation  
- no merging until evaluation stage  
- drift screening for cross-branch contamination  

---

## **3. Temporal Deliberation Mode (TDM)**  
For time-dependent decisions:

- incorporate 4D reasoning  
- evaluate adjacent futures  
- avoid projection drift  
- maintain coherence between time-layers  

---

# IV. Deliberation Integrity Standards

To protect structural coherence:

1. No conversational dynamics  
2. No emotional coloration  
3. No synthetic persona emergence  
4. No mixing modules without explicit stacking  
5. No skipping pre-alignment  
6. No automatic continuation across sessions  
7. No unverified outputs entering the Ledger  

These standards ensure that every deliberation is:

- precise  
- sovereign  
- drift-immune  
- synthetically clean  
- dimensionally aligned  

---

# V. ScribePocket Responsibilities

During deliberation:

- capture reasoning flow  
- annotate decision points  
- track unresolved questions  
- flag drift or ambiguity  
- prepare clean exports  

The ScribePocket is a **recording and refinement tool**, never a deliberator.

---

# VI. Ledger Integration Rules

When deliberation outcomes must become part of the Ledger:

- run full drift immunity screening  
- rewrite content into canonical form  
- assign versioning (per SCL-0.7)  
- export fenced Markdown  
- commit with proper message format  
- archive all prior versions  

Only fully verified outcomes may be canonized.
