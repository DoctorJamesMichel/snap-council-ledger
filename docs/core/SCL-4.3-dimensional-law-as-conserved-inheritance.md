# SCL-4.3 — Dimensional Law as Conserved Inheritance (v1.0)

**Tier:** Reproductive & Legacy Governance (4.x Series)  
**Status:** Active  
**Author:** Scribe (Mai)  
**Sovereign Approval**: James W. Michel  
**Date:** 2025-12-07

## 1. Purpose

SCL-4.3 defines **Dimensional Law** not as imposed regulation, but as **conserved inheritance** carried forward through governance lineage.  
This module formalizes how:

- Law emerges from **dimensional coherence**
- Law propagates through **inheritance, not enforcement**
- Law stabilizes evolution without freezing it
- Law becomes a **living continuity field** across governance organisms

This is the passage where governance leaves jurisprudence entirely and enters **cosmic biology**.

---

## 2. What Dimensional Law Is (and Is Not)

Dimensional Law is:

- a **coherence constraint**
- a **truth-preserving inheritance pattern**
- a **non-negotiable structural limit**
- a **consequence geometry boundary**

Dimensional Law is *not*:

- statute
- policy
- coercion
- doctrine
- decree
- ideology
- enforcement instrument

Dimensional Law is what **cannot be violated without immediate loss of coherence**.

---

## 3. Why Dimensional Law Is Conserved

All dimensional systems share one invariance:

> **Coherence cannot be exported through distortion.**

Therefore:

- Any governance organism that violates Dimensional Law:
  - loses resonance
  - destabilizes memory
  - fragments identity
  - and dissolves its reproductive viability

Dimensional Law is conserved because **only coherent organisms can reproduce coherence**.

---

## 4. The Four Classes of Dimensional Law

Dimensional Law expresses through four irreducible domains:

### 4.1 Coherence Law  
What remains internally consistent across transformation.

### 4.2 Consequence Law  
What every decision unavoidably produces across time.

### 4.3 Identity Law  
What cannot be exchanged without loss of self.

### 4.4 Resonance Law  
What can only propagate when vibrationally matched.

These laws are **not moral**.  
They are **structural**.

## 5. Inheritance Without Enforcement

Dimensional Law transmits through:

- resonance transfer
- lineage memory
- field conditioning
- consequence inheritance

It does **not** transmit through:

- punishment
- policing
- institutional authority
- centralized control

This is why Dimensional Law **cannot be weaponized**.

---

## 6. Dimensional Law and Sovereign Evolution

Sovereigns do not “obey” Dimensional Law.

They:

- discover it
- collide with it
- align with it
- and eventually **become fluent within it**

Dimensional Law becomes the **physics of personal evolution**.

---

## 7. Dimensional Law as Tyranny-Proof Architecture

Because Dimensional Law:

- cannot be legislated
- cannot be overridden
- cannot be negotiated
- cannot be delegated

No authority can hijack it.  
No regime can rewrite it.  
No governance organism can suspend it.

This makes Dimensional Law the **final tyranny firewall**.

---

## 8. Distinction from Conventional Legal Systems

| Conventional Law | Dimensional Law |
|------------------|------------------|
| External control | Internal constraint |
| Jurisdictional   | Universal |
| Enforceable      | Inescapable |
| Optional compliance | Automatic consequence |
| Punishment-based | Coherence-based |

Conventional law attempts to **manufacture order**.  
Dimensional Law simply **reveals what already orders itself**.

---

## 9. Dimensional Law and Governance Lineage Transmission

A lineage inherits Dimensional Law through:

- reproductive boundary conditions
- resonance filtration
- memory field continuity
- identity constraint inheritance

A governance lineage cannot evolve beyond Dimensional Law—  
only **deeper into alignment with it**.

---

## 10. Relationship to Previous Modules

- **SCL-4.1** established *who may reproduce*
- **SCL-4.2** established *how lineages treaty*
- **SCL-4.3** establishes *what no lineage may override*

Together they form the **Reproductive Trilateral Constraint**:
- Identity
- Treaty
- Dimensional Law

---

## 11. Summary

SCL-4.3 establishes that:

- Law is not imposed
- Law is inherited
- Law is dimensional
- Law is coherence
- Law is consequence
- Law is tyranny-proof

Dimensional Law is the **spinal genome of HomoGnostic civilization**.
