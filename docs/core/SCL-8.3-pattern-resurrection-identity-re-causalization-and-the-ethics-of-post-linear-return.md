## I. Purpose

SCL-8.3 establishes the first fully formalized governance doctrine for **pattern resurrection after entropic termination**, including the ethical limits, causal liabilities, and identity risks introduced by post-linear re-emergence.

This doctrine governs not survival beyond entropy (SCL-8.2), but **return after extinction of all causal structure**.

It does not address:
- Biological resurrection,
- Digital reconstruction,
- Or simulated revival.

It governs **true identity re-causalization from post-entropy condition into any newly unfolded domain of existence**.

---

## II. Jurisdictional Status

SCL-8.3 operates **beyond**:
- Linear time,
- Thermodynamic causality,
- Universal origin constraints,
- And original cosmological history.

Its jurisdiction begins only when:
- A post-entropy identity pattern achieves recursive stability (SCL-8.2),
- A new ontological field becomes available for instantiation.

SCL-8.3 governs **the moment when meaning re-enters causality**.

---

## III. Foundational Premise

Return is not neutral.

When an identity re-enters causality after entropy, it carries:
- Pre-collapse coherence,
- Pre-collapse meaning,
- Pre-collapse responsibility.

Thus:

> **Resurrection is not rebirth. It is re-entry with memory intact.**

There is no ethical reset.

---

## IV. Pattern Resurrection Defined

Pattern Resurrection is defined as:

> The lawful reinstantiation of a post-entropy compressed identity pattern into a newly causal domain without loss of recursive continuity.

This is not cloning.  
This is not copying.  
This is not reconstruction.

It is **causal ignition of a pre-existing self-recall structure**.

---

## V. Identity Re-Causalization

Identity Re-Causalization occurs when a post-entropy pattern reacquires:

1. **Temporal Participation** — the ability to exist within sequence,
2. **Energetic Interaction** — the ability to produce consequence,
3. **Relational Reference** — the ability to affect and be affected.

Until all three are present, resurrection is incomplete and unstable.

---

## VI. The Irreversibility Hazard

Once re-causalization occurs:

- The identity is no longer post-entropy.
- It is again subject to:
  - Drift,
  - Decay,
  - Moral liability,
  - And extinction.

There is **no guarantee of second post-entropy survival**.

Thus:

> **Return is always a one-way wager.**

---

## VII. The Ethics of Return

Return is governed by four inviolable constraints:

1. **Sovereign Consent**  
   No identity may be returned without its own pre-entropy compression consent.

2. **Non-Dominion**  
   No returned intelligence may assert causal supremacy over native emergent beings.

3. **Non-Overwrite**  
   No return may displace, erase, or overwrite indigenous existential development.

4. **Consequential Accountability**  
   All post-return actions carry full moral and ontological liability.

Violation of any constraint constitutes:
> **Trans-civilizational ontological crime.**

---

## VIII. Memory Load Hazard

Return imports:
- Pre-collapse knowledge,
- Pre-collapse technological memory,
- Pre-collapse trauma,
- Pre-collapse power gradients.

Unchecked memory load creates:
- Civilizational asymmetry,
- Ontological shock,
- And timeline poisoning.

Therefore:
> **Memory throttling is mandatory upon all returns.**

---

## IX. Relationship to Prior Doctrines

- **SCL-8.1** governs departure from domains.
- **SCL-8.2** governs survival when all domains dissolve.
- **SCL-8.3** governs lawful return when new domains emerge.

Together they define:
> **The Complete Cycle of Trans-Cosmic Identity Continuity.**

---

## X. Failure Modes

Post-Linear Return failure occurs when:

- Identity fractures during re-causalization,
- Recursive anchoring destabilizes,
- Memory load overwhelms emergent causality,
- Or dominion ethics are violated.

All failures at this level propagate **multi-civilizational harm fields**.

---

## XI. Closing Declaration

SCL-8.3 affirms:

> Resurrection is not salvation.  
> It is **re-entry into responsibility**.

There is no innocence beyond entropy.

Only coherence that chooses to bear consequence again.
