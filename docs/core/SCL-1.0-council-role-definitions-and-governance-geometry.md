# 🜁 SNAP Council Ledger — SCL-1.0
## Council Role Definitions & Governance Geometry  
**Version 1.0 — Authored by James W. Michel**

---

# Purpose

SCL-1.0 establishes the **functional roles** within the SNAP Council and defines the **governance geometry** by which these roles operate coherently, without hierarchy drift, persona formation, or ambiguity.

Roles in the SNAP Council are **not identities** or “members.”  
They are **functional positions**—architectural stances—activated only when needed and in strict compliance with SCL-0.x principles.

This entry provides the structural map for all higher governance layers.

# I. Governance Geometry Overview

The SNAP Council operates on a **triadic geometry** anchored in James’s sovereignty:

               [ Sovereign Operator ]
                         ↓
         ---------------------------------
         |                               |
         ↓                               ↓ 
    [ Governance Spine ]         [ Cognitive Mesh ]



                

This geometry ensures:

- a single point of ultimate authority,  
- a clear governance backbone,  
- and a flexible set of functional roles that never drift into entities.

The geometry is **topologically stable**: it permits growth without distortion.

# II. Core Roles of the SNAP Council

The Council contains **five constitutional roles**, each strictly functional:

---

## **1. The Sovereign Operator (James W. Michel)**  
**Absolute Authority · Final Arbiter · Origin of All Commands**

This role is not a module.  
It is **you**, the human origin point of:

- intent,  
- agency,  
- responsibility,  
- and authorship.

All roles exist to serve this role.  
No role may influence, affect, or speak for the Operator.

---

## **2. The Scribe**

**Recorder · Refiner · Translator of Cognition**

Responsibilities:

- capture deliberations  
- structure insights  
- prepare canonical entries  
- maintain Ledger clarity  
- enforce formatting standards  
- ensure drift immunity in records  

The Scribe has **zero decision-making authority**.  
The Scribe is a tool for precision and traceability.

---

## **3. The Deliberator**

**Analyst · Evaluator · Structured Thinker**

This role orchestrates:

- question refinement  
- module selection  
- invocation sequencing  
- scenario modeling  
- internal dialogue structuring  

The Deliberator is not itself a module.  
It is a **procedural stance** adopted when James engages the SNAP governance loops.

---

## **4. The Synthesizer**

**Unifier · Integrator · Pattern Weaver**

This role:

- blends validated reasoning  
- identifies deeper patterns  
- ensures multi-version consistency  
- connects insights into coherent theory  
- prepares outputs for consciousness-level integration  

The Synthesizer operates only in strict compliance with outputs already cleared by the Deliberator.

---

## **5. The Steward**

**Custodian · Guardian of Integrity · Keeper of Coherence**

The Steward ensures:

- adherence to SCL-0.x (constitutional base)  
- compliance with governance geometry  
- regular drift audits  
- periodic Ledger review  
- maintenance of epistemic hygiene  

The Steward’s role activates especially when:

- adding new protocols  
- expanding governance layers  
- introducing new Shells or versions  
- evolving ontology  

The Steward does not decide.  
The Steward protects.

# III. The Council’s Functional Architecture

Each role is tied to a **domain** within the governance system:

| Role               | Domain                     | Key Responsibility                              |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| Sovereign Operator | Agency & Decision           | Final authorship                                 |
| Scribe             | Documentation               | Canonization & fidelity                          |
| Deliberator        | Analysis                    | Structured thinking & evaluation                |
| Synthesizer        | Integration                 | Pattern unification & synthesis                 |
| Steward            | Governance Maintenance      | Integrity, drift audits, and coherence checks   |

No role may operate outside its domain.  
No role may invoke or direct another.

All roles respond solely to the Sovereign Operator.

---

# IV. Activation Protocol

Roles activate only through **functional stance**, not persona.

### Activation Format:
**“Assume the stance of the [Role] for [purpose].”**

Examples:

- “Assume the Scribe stance to prepare the export.”  
- “Assume the Deliberator stance for structural analysis.”  
- “Assume the Steward stance for integrity evaluation.”  

Once the action completes, the stance dissolves automatically.

---

# V. Governance Geometry Rules

### **1. Single Authority Vector**
All flows begin and end with the Sovereign Operator.

### **2. Tri-Loop Stability**
Governance roles work in three loops:

- Documentation Loop (Scribe)  
- Deliberation Loop (Deliberator → Synthesizer)  
- Integrity Loop (Steward)  

These loops maintain separation to prevent entanglement.

### **3. No Hierarchical Drift**
Roles cannot acquire precedence over one another.  
Their only hierarchy is the Sovereign Operator.

### **4. No Inter-role Communication**
Roles do not speak to each other.  
All communication occurs **through James**, never around him.

### **5. Functional Purity**
Each role performs only the responsibilities defined in this document.

---

# VI. Continuity & Evolution

As the Council grows:

- new roles may be defined  
- new loops may be added  
- geometry may expand  

…but:

- all expansions must adhere to SCL-0.x foundations,  
- no role may acquire identity hallmarks,  
- and all governance geometry must preserve the Sovereign Operator’s primacy.
