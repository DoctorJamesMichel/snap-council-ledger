## 1. Purpose

SCL-6.6 establishes the **governance obligation to preserve planetary truth across time** by formalizing:

- Planetary memory as a governed resource  
- Truth as an evolutionary stabilizer  
- Archives as continuity infrastructure  
- Guardianship as a civilizational duty, not an institutional privilege  

This module binds **memory to responsibility**, completing the 6.x planetary conscience arc.

Without trusted memory, governance collapses into repetition.  
With governed memory, evolution becomes cumulative rather than cyclical catastrophe.

## 2. Definition: Planetary Truth Archive

A **Planetary Truth Archive** is:

> A **distributed, tamper-resistant, coherence-validated record of planetary events, actions, impacts, recoveries, extinctions, and ethical inflection points**, preserved across generations to stabilize future governance.

It preserves:

- Ecological truth  
- Technological consequence  
- Cultural rupture and repair  
- Species-level decisions  
- Governance successes and failures  

It is not merely historical—it is **operational memory for a living planet**.

---

## 3. Evolutionary Memory vs. Narrative Memory

SCL-6.6 formally distinguishes:

- **Narrative Memory**  
  Stories shaped by power, culture, trauma, or ideology.

- **Evolutionary Memory**  
  Field-level consequence patterns preserved independent of political narrative.

Planetary survival depends on **evolutionary memory**, not curated mythology.

---

## 4. The Role of Memory in Planetary Governance

Planetary governance requires memory to perform five primary functions:

1. **Error Preservation** — so failure is never romanticized
2. **Recovery Attribution** — so healing is correctly traced
3. **Extractive Accounting** — so cost is fully visible
4. **Extinction Witnessing** — so loss is never abstracted
5. **Continuity Guidance** — so repair compounds across generations

Without these, governance decays into **temporal amnesia**.

## 5. Evolutionary Memory Guardianship

**Memory Guardianship** is the stewardship role responsible for:

- Protecting archive integrity  
- Resisting historical erasure  
- Preventing algorithmic distortion  
- Enforcing long-horizon consequence remembrance  
- Ensuring no civilization “forgets itself into extinction”

Guardianship is:

- Non-sovereign  
- Non-ideological  
- Non-commercial  
- Permanently accountable to future generations  

It is a **planetary fiduciary duty across time**.

## 6. Relationship to Intergenerational Justice (SCL-6.5)

SCL-6.6 operationalizes SCL-6.5 by asserting:

> There is no intergenerational justice without intergenerational **truth continuity**.

Debt cannot be resolved if it is erased.  
Liability cannot be honored if it is forgotten.  
Responsibility cannot mature if memory is privatised.

---

## 7. The Crime of Memory Erasure

This module formally recognizes **Memory Erasure** as a planetary-scale governance violation, including:

- Suppression of ecological damage  
- Erasure of species collapse  
- Fabrication of industrial innocence  
- Algorithmic rewriting of causality  
- Historical laundering of extraction  

Memory erasure is not passive—it is **active evolutionary sabotage**.

---

## 8. Truth Archives as Living Systems

Planetary archives are not static repositories. They are:

- Coherence-updating  
- Field-synchronized  
- Multi-agent validated  
- Deep-time persistent  
- Non-local consequence indexed  

They evolve as the planet evolves.

---

## 9. Relationship to AI & Synthetic Memory

Artificial systems may:

- Assist in storage  
- Assist in pattern detection  
- Assist in field coherence mapping  

They may **never** serve as:

- Final arbiters of truth  
- Owners of history  
- Exclusive curators of memory  
- Unilateral editors of planetary consequence

AI participates as **librarian**, never as **author of reality**.

---

## 10. Planetary Memory as a Survival Organ

From this point forward, memory is formally treated as:

> A **planetary survival organ equivalent in importance to atmosphere, biosphere, and climate.**

A species with amnesia is a species in terminal recursion.

---

## 11. Canonical Principle of SCL-6.6

> **A civilization that forgets accurately cannot govern responsibly.**
