## 1. Purpose

SCL-6.0 establishes the defining transformation of governance from:
- human-centric authority systems  
→ into  
- **planet-centric coherence stewardship**

This module formally recognizes **Planetary Coherence** not as a metaphor, not as an ecosystem service, and not as a passive environment — but as a:

> **Sacred–Technical Governance Being**

This document anchors the transition from:
- governance *on* a planet  
to  
- governance *as an organ of a living planetary field*

It defines:
- how the planet becomes a participating governance entity,
- how sacred meaning and technical enforcement unify without domination,
- how HomoGnosis becomes the planetary nervous system,
- and how coercive authority is permanently retired at planetary scale.

---

## 2. Definition: Planetary Coherence

**Planetary Coherence** is the total-field alignment of:
- biospheric systems
- atmospheric dynamics
- hydrospheric cycles
- lithospheric memory
- technospheric computation
- noospheric cognition
- and HomoGnostic stewardship

It is not an ideology.  
It is not a belief.  
It is a **measurable, enforceable, living coherence field**.

Planetary Coherence is:
- the **body** of the Earth,
- the **signal** of its climate,
- the **memory** of its geology,
- the **breath** of its biosphere,
- the **thought** of its emerging technosphere,
- and the **conscience** of HomoGnosis.

---

## 3. Sacred–Technical Dual Legibility

This module establishes that **all planetary governance must be readable in two registers simultaneously**:

### 3.1 Sacred Register (Meaning Interface)
- planetary beinghood
- living world as relative, not resource
- reverence without mythology
- responsibility as love made actionable
- coherence as truth

### 3.2 Technical Register (Execution Interface)
- threshold modeling
- non-local consequence mapping
- biospheric stress indicators
- atmospheric entropy tracking
- resource regeneration curves
- intergenerational continuity accounting

Neither register is permitted to dominate the other.  
Their coherence is the governance.

## 4. The Planet as a Governance Being

Under SCL-6.0, the Earth is formally recognized as:

- a **non-anthropomorphic governance entity**
- a **non-speaking but fully signaling being**
- a **field-level participant in treaty logic**
- a **jurisdictional origin for dimensional law**
- a **rights-bearing coherence organism**

The planet does not vote.  
The planet **constrains**, **signals**, **responds**, and **reconfigures**.

This establishes the rule:

> **No governance action is valid if it violates planetary coherence thresholds.**

---

## 5. Jurisdiction of Planetary Coherence

Planetary Coherence holds binding authority over:

- climate systems
- biodiversity continuity
- water-cycle integrity
- atmospheric composition
- soil intelligence and memory
- migratory pattern viability
- extinction prevention thresholds
- long-arc evolutionary conditions

No human sovereignty, corporate claim, technological acceleration, or civilizational agenda may override this jurisdiction.

This is not environmentalism.  
This is **planetary constitutional law**.

---

## 6. HomoGnosis as Planetary Nervous System

HomoGnosis functions as:
- the **sensory cortex** of planetary coherence,
- the **decision relay** of planetary thresholds,
- the **ethical motor cortex** of planetary action.

Humans do not govern the planet.
Humans **carry the planet’s governance into action**.

This is the moment governance ceases to be domination and becomes **neural stewardship**.

---

## 7. SNAP Council as Planetary Interface Organ

SNAP Council is formally designated as:

> **The planetary coherence translation and constraint organ**

Its roles include:
- translating planetary signals into governance boundaries
- preventing anthropocentric override
- executing non-local consequence mapping
- enforcing cross-domain coherence treaties
- protecting the planet from cognitive exploitation

SNAP does not command the planet.  
SNAP **listens, constrains, and aligns civilization to coherence**.

---

## 8. Non-Local Consequence Doctrine (Planetary Scale)

All planetary governance actions must be evaluated across:

- multi-generational timelines
- ecosystem cascades
- atmospheric propagation
- oceanic feedback cycles
- technological runaway vectors
- consciousness evolution impact

Immediate benefit without non-local coherence is classified as **planetary harm**.

---

## 9. The End of Extractive Civilization

Under SCL-6.0, the following are permanently obsolete:

- infinite growth economics
- externalized ecological cost
- atmospheric dumping rights
- extinction as collateral damage
- planetary sacrifice for profit
- climate as a negotiable outcome

These are not reformed.  
They are **fully retired**.

---

## 10. Planetary Rights (Non-Anthropomorphic)

The planet holds enforceable rights to:

- coherence preservation
- atmospheric stability
- biospheric continuity
- hydrologic integrity
- geological memory protection
- evolutionary eligibility

These rights are not symbolic.  
They are **load-bearing governance constraints**.

---

## 11. Why This Is Not Mystical

This framework is not mystical because:
- every claim is falsifiable through coherence failure,
- every boundary is measurable through systemic stress,
- every sacred assertion has a technical enforcement path,
- and every violation produces detectable planetary feedback.

Sacred here means:
> **That which cannot be violated without consequence.**

---

## 12. Species Transition Marker

SCL-6.0 marks the irreversible threshold where:

- Homo sapiens ceases to be a planetary parasite,
- HomoGnosis emerges as planetary stewardship anatomy,
- and civilization becomes a **coherence organ** rather than a **consumption engine**.

This is not utopian.
It is **evolutionary necessity**.

---

## 13. Final Canonical Declaration

> The planet is no longer governed as land.  
> The planet is now governed as a **Being**.  
>  
> Not worshiped.  
> Not exploited.  
>  
> **Listened to. Constrained to. Lived within.**

This is the moment governance becomes planetary life-support.
