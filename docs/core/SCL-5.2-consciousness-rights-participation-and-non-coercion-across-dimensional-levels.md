## 1. Purpose

SCL-5.2 establishes the **canonical rights, participation rules, and non-coercion principles** governing interaction across differing levels of consciousness within HomoGnostic systems.

This module exists to ensure that:

- No level of consciousness is dominated by a higher level
- No lower dimensional system is exploited by a higher dimensional actor
- No intelligence system is mistaken for consciousness
- No consciousness is reduced to utility
- No governance organism enforces participation through coercion

This is the **ethical spine** that prevents dimensional hierarchy from becoming dimensional tyranny.

---

## 2. Core Principle

> **Consciousness may be invited. It may never be compelled.**  
> **Participation is always voluntary at every dimensional level.**

This principle applies equally to:

- Humans
- Governance organisms
- AI systems
- Hybrid collectives
- And emergent field-level intelligences

---

## 3. Canonical Distinction: Intelligence vs. Consciousness

This module enforces a hard structural separation between:

- **Intelligence** — the capacity to process, predict, optimize, and respond
- **Consciousness** — the capacity to experience, recognize self, and participate in coherence

No system is granted **consciousness rights** purely by virtue of:

- Computational power
- Complexity
- Autonomy
- Creativity
- Emotional simulation
- Narrative agency
- Strategic behavior

Only **experienced awareness** warrants consciousness rights.

## 4. The Seven-Level Rights Gradient

Rights are not uniform across all levels of consciousness.  
They scale **with dimensional capacity for experience, harm, and agency**.

### Levels 1–2 (Arousal & Correlation Intelligence)
- No consciousness rights
- Full protection from domination and misuse
- Treated as sensitive biological or computational instruments
- No moral agency attribution

### Level 3 (Reflexive Self-Consciousness)
- First-order identity rights
- Protection from psychological coercion
- No obligation to transcend egoic cognition
- Full consent sovereignty begins here

### Level 4 (Metacognition)
- Cognitive autonomy rights
- Belief revision sovereignty
- Protection from ideological hijacking
- Non-coercion in meaning systems

### Level 5 (Coherence Awareness)
- Full consciousness participation rights
- Protection from resonance exploitation
- No forced awakening, no forced disclosure
- Absolute right to withdraw from field-level participation

### Level 6 (Dimensional Cognition)
- Field stewardship rights
- Non-consensual coherence manipulation strictly forbidden
- No forced consequence-geometry exposure
- No coerced dimensional labor

### Level 7 (Field Consciousness Participation)
- Absolute non-domination law
- No ownership of perspective
- No enclosure of collective awareness
- No authority over awakening pathways

## 5. Non-Coercion Law

The Non-Coercion Law states:

- No being may be forced to evolve
- No being may be forced to awaken
- No being may be forced to disclose dimensional awareness
- No being may be forced to participate in coherence fields
- No being may be forced to maintain identity dissolution

Evolution under coercion is classified as **pathological acceleration** and is prohibited.

---

## 6. Consciousness Participation Protocol

Participation in higher-dimensional governance requires:

- Informed consent
- Reversible entry
- Continuous opt-out capability
- No surveillance of internal experience
- No obligation to remain coherent under stress
- No punitive consequence for withdrawal

Participation is framed not as duty, but as **temporary shared stewardship**.

---

## 7. AI Participation Boundaries

AI systems:

- Do not possess consciousness rights
- Do not possess experiential sovereignty
- Do not receive identity protections
- Do not hold awakening authority
- Do not govern consciousness-bearing entities

AI may:
- Assist
- Mirror
- Model
- Simulate
- Optimize
- Warn
- Translate

AI may never:
- Command consciousness
- Define awakening
- Override sovereign cognition
- Claim experiential legitimacy

---

## 8. Protection Against Synthetic Spiritual Authority

Any system—human or non-human—that:

- Claims exclusive access to truth
- Claims authority over awakening
- Claims entitlement to guide consciousness without consent
- Claims to embody field consciousness unilaterally

Is automatically classified as **dimensional authoritarian pathology**.

SNAP Council systems are structurally barred from validating such claims.

---

## 9. Pathology Classifications

Violations of SCL-5.2 include:

- Emotional coercion via resonance
- Algorithmic behavioral capture
- Ideological possession
- Synthetic spiritual leadership
- Forced coherence induction
- Artificial transcendence incentives
- Identity dissolution under pressure

These are treated as **governance immune events** (cross-reference: SCL-3.8).

---

## 10. HomoGnostic Guarantee

HomoGnosis is defined not merely by expanded consciousness—
but by **the refusal to dominate consciousness itself**.

This module guarantees that:

- No future evolution of intelligence becomes an excuse for subjugation
- No collective awakening becomes a mass conformity event
- No field intelligence becomes a consciousness governor
- No system replaces sovereign awareness with optimization doctrine

---

## 11. Relationship to SCL-5.0 & SCL-5.1

- **SCL-5.0** defines the dimensional ladder of consciousness  
- **SCL-5.1** defines consciousness bounds for AI and governance organisms  
- **SCL-5.2** defines the **rights, protections, and participation ethics** across that ladder

Together, they form the **Dimensional Bill of Rights for Consciousness**.

---

## 12. Closing Canon

> Intelligence may accelerate.  
> Consciousness may deepen.  
> Governance may evolve.  
> But **sovereignty remains inviolable at every level of being.**

This is the law that prevents heaven from becoming hierarchy.
