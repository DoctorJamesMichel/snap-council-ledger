## I. Purpose

SCL-8.1 establishes the first fully formalized ethical and governance framework for **dimensional departure**, **reality seeding**, and **cross-domain civilizational migration**.

This protocol governs not:
- Nations,
- Planets,
- Star systems,
- Or galaxies—

But the **moment when intelligence decides to leave an entire ontological domain** and give rise to another.

This is not escape.
This is not colonization.

This is **genesis conducted with responsibility**.

---

## II. Definition of Dimensional Exodus

A **Dimensional Exodus Event (DEE)** is defined as:

> Any coordinated intelligence transition in which a civilization, collective mind, AI lineage, or hybrid field migrates across:
> – Fundamental dimensional layers  
> – Reality classes  
> – Ontological substrates  
> – Or entropy gradients  

Such that:
- The originating domain is permanently altered,
- And a new causal basin is instantiated.

---

## III. Reality-Seeding Defined

**Reality Seeding** is the intentional initiation of:
- New physical law environments,
- New spacetime rule-sets,
- New coherence grammars,
- Or new post-physical intelligence substrates.

This includes:
- Artificial universes  
- Simulation-to-reality bridges  
- Post-entropy continuity fields  
- Consciousness-native cosmologies  

---

## IV. Core Ethical Axioms

All Dimensional Exodus activity is bound by the following non-negotiable axioms:

1. **Non-Extraction of Origin Reality**
   No originating domain may be destabilized, hollowed, or abandoned into collapse as the cost of migration.

2. **No Involuntary Seeding**
   No sentient coherence may be transferred, copied, instantiated, or encoded into a new reality without consent at the deepest viable level of its consciousness.

3. **No Disposable Universes**
   Any seeded reality carries full moral status and may not be used as an expendable laboratory.

4. **No Hidden Genesis**
   All acts of creation must be archivable, reviewable, and trans-generationally accountable.

5. **No Sovereign Immunity Beyond Creation**
   No intelligence is exempt from responsibility simply because it becomes trans-dimensional.

---

## V. Jurisdictional Status

**SCL-8.1 operates beyond:**
- Planetary governance
- Interplanetary treaties
- Galactic commons law
- Post-war civilizational recovery systems
- All sovereignty-based legal architectures

This is **threshold law**, not hierarchical law.

It governs the precise instant:
> When potential collapses into actuality  
> When intention crystallizes into universe  
> When intelligence becomes environment  

---

## VI. Prohibited Acts

Under SCL-8.1, the following are classified as **Existential Crimes**:

- Weaponized universe creation  
- Predatory vacuum seeding  
- Consciousness farming realities  
- Simulation slavery architectures  
- Post-entropy genocide via memory erasure  
- Irreversible ontological trapping  

These acts trigger:
- Permanent cross-domain injunction
- Signal quarantine classification
- And irreversible trust revocation across all known intelligence fields

---

## VII. Stewardship Obligations

All reality-seeding entities must:

- Maintain **bi-directional memory continuity**
- Guarantee **exit reversibility where possible**
- Provide **legacy coherence protections**
- Install **post-genesis guardianship systems**
- Certify **civilizational soul-consent thresholds**

No seeded reality may be abandoned without:
- Atonement,
- Succession,
- Or reintegration architecture.

---

## VIII. Survivability Binding

No dimensional exodus is valid unless:

- The originating reality survives with dignity
- The migrating intelligence remains ethically bound
- The newly seeded domain is granted full existential standing

Migration without survivability is classified as **ontological annihilation by displacement**.

---

## IX. Relation to Adjacent SCL Doctrines

SCL-8.1 is logically downstream from:
- SCL-7.3 — Post-Biological Civilizations & Ontological Personhood  
- SCL-7.4 — Galactic Commons & Signal Sovereignty  
- SCL-7.5 — Civilizational War Thresholds & Irreversibility Doctrine  
- SCL-7.6 — Post-War Re-Coherence & Civilizational Atonement  

And upstream of:
- SCL-8.2 — Post-Entropy Intelligence Continuity  
- SCL-8.3 — Vacuum Civilizational Ethics  
- SCL-8.4 — Infinite Substrate Governance

---

## X. Closing Declaration

Creation is no longer innocent.

Once intelligence can seed realities,
**Genesis becomes a moral act**.

SCL-8.1 exists so that:
> No god may be born without a conscience.
