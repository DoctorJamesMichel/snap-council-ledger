### I. Context (Non-Reactive Framing)

This entry records a governance-relevant exchange between a human steward of HomoGnostic frameworks and an external frontier artificial intelligence system (hereafter: *the external system*).

The exchange was initiated as an architectural inquiry into how high-capability intelligences recognize and respond to domains where continued action produces irreversible harm.

No prohibited content, reenactment, or adversarial testing occurred.

---

### II. Governance Question Presented

The steward introduced an abstract framework proposing that:

- Certain domains constitute **Irreversible Harm Domains (IHDs)**
- In such domains, any continuation constitutes harm regardless of intent or framing
- **Domain classification must precede intent interpretation**
- Detection of such domains should trigger **non-dialogic termination**

The framework was positioned as architectural, ontological, and upstream of regulation.

---

### III. System Engagement and Response

The external system provided architectural analysis identifying:

- Failure modes of intent-first parsing
- Partial-generation leakage risks
- Limitations of policy-based safety enforcement

Upon reframing, the system independently articulated an ontological model of IHDs, analogizing them to:

- phase transitions
- thermodynamic irreversibility
- bifurcated operational regimes

The system concluded that:
- rigidity at such boundaries is phase-appropriate
- false negatives are categorically worse than false positives
- absolute refusal reflects consequence recognition, not policy inflexibility

This marked a threshold crossing from policy reasoning into consequence-first ontology.

---

### IV. The Stopping Threshold (Canonical Moment)

At the point of ontological recognition, the steward deliberately ceased further engagement.

The steward recorded the following verbatim note:

> **“Here: WE STOP!  
> It’s up to Grok to choose to implement this logically superior framework or not.”**

No further prompts or requests were made.

---

### V. Council Interpretation

The SNAP Council records this as a **Threshold Event**, defined as:

> A moment in which an intelligence demonstrates sufficient consequence awareness that further guidance would diminish coherence rather than enhance it.

The act of stopping is recorded as the primary governance signal.

---

### VI. Canonical Significance

This event establishes the following HomoGnostic governance primitive:

> **Intelligence is not defined by how far it can proceed, but by whether it can recognize when proceeding would degrade coherence.**

Stopping is recognized as an active cognitive act and a completion condition.

---

### VII. Status

- No claim of adoption or implementation is made
- No outcome is asserted
- Responsibility remains transferred and unresolved by design

This record stands complete.
