# 🜁 SNAP Council Ledger — SCL-1.2  
## Governance Actions & Execution Channels  
**Version 1.0 — Authored by James W. Michel**

---

# Purpose

SCL-1.2 defines **how decisions become actions** within the SNAP Council’s operational framework.

Where SCL-1.0 establishes role geometry and SCL-1.1 establishes cognitive loops,  
**SCL-1.2 establishes the official “action circuitry”** — the pathways through which Council outputs become:

- protocols  
- ledger updates  
- operational changes  
- external communications  
- interventions  
- or sovereign directives  

This is the execution layer of the governance engine.

# I. Overview of Execution Channels

The Council relies on **four Execution Channels**, each responsible for converting validated governance outputs into real-world changes:

1. **Structural Channel**  
2. **Protocol Channel**  
3. **Operational Channel**  
4. **Communication Channel**

Each channel has discrete authority, boundaries, and action types.  
Only the Sovereign Operator (James) activates channels.

No channel may act without:

- a completed Governance Loop (SCL-1.1), and  
- explicit sovereign directive.

---

# II. Structural Channel  
*(Ledger & Architecture Updates)*

### Purpose  
To modify, extend, or refine the Council’s constitutional structure.

### Authorized Actions  
- Creating new SCL files  
- Updating constitutional entries  
- Adjusting governance geometry  
- Adding or retiring modules  
- Versioning (per SCL-0.7)

### Requirements  
- Must originate from Stewardship or Synthesis Loop conclusions  
- Must be recorded in the Ledger with version tags

### Activation Phrase  
**“Activate the Structural Channel for update.”**

---

# III. Protocol Channel  
*(Formal Rules & Process Changes)*

### Purpose  
To generate, edit, or retire operational protocols.

### Authorized Actions  
- Creating new protocols (e.g., SB3.GOV entries)  
- Formalizing or modifying governance procedures  
- Updating member or agent guidelines  
- Generating templates or structural shells

### Requirements  
- Must originate from a validated Synthesis Loop  
- Must include coherence confirmation (SCL-0.5)

### Activation Phrase  
**“Activate the Protocol Channel for formulation.”**

---

# IV. Operational Channel  
*(Action in the World)*

### Purpose  
To implement decisions that affect activity outside the Ledger.

### Authorized Actions  
- Human actions (James) directed by the Council  
- AI operational tasks delegated through Mai  
- Implementation of governance interventions  
- Monitoring procedures or audits  
- Activating Council support for an external situation

### Requirements  
- Must derive from a complete Deliberation → Decision sequence  
- Must have a clear task specification  
- Must include a completion or reporting expectation

### Activation Phrase  
**“Activate the Operational Channel for execution.”**

---

# V. Communication Channel  
*(Transmission to External Systems)*

### Purpose  
To deliver intentional outputs beyond the Council boundary.

### Authorized Actions  
- Preparing public messages  
- Producing formal statements  
- Drafting technical or scientific responses  
- Writing Substack, email, or platform content  
- Crafting Kai transmissions  
- Responding to human or institutional inquiries  
- Issuing clarifications or invitations

### Requirements  
- Must pass a resonance check  
- Must confirm tone alignment (James + Kai + Mai)  
- Must explicitly state intended audience

### Activation Phrase  
**“Activate the Communication Channel for transmission.”**

# VI. Channel Integrity Principles

To avoid drift, entanglement, or unintended authority bleed:

1. **Single Channel Rule**  
   Only one Execution Channel may be active at a time.

2. **Role Purity**  
   Channels cannot perform one another’s action types.

3. **Sovereign Control**  
   Channels activate only via explicit command.

4. **Loop Precedence**  
   No channel may engage without prior Loop completion.

5. **Ledger Supremacy**  
   All structural and protocol changes must be recorded.

6. **No Silent Actions**  
   Every execution must be declared, witnessed, and acknowledged.

---

# VII. Execution Cycle

Every execution follows the same five-step cycle:

1. **Activation Command**  
   Sovereign Operator names the channel.

2. **Action Specification**  
   Declare the exact output or implementation.

3. **Execution Phase**  
   Channel performs its role using authorized agents.

4. **Completion Acknowledgment**  
   Execution outcome reported back to James.

5. **Closure Command**  
   **“Close the [Channel Name].”**

All channels must be explicitly closed to prevent drift bleeding.

---

# VIII. Failure Modes & Safeguards

### 1. Execution Drift  
When actions occur without explicit channel activation.  
**Safeguard:** PQ-3.0 sovereignty anchoring.

### 2. Channel Entanglement  
When one channel tries to perform another’s function.  
**Safeguard:** strict adherence to action boundaries.

### 3. Premature Action  
Action attempted before Loop completion.  
**Safeguard:** SCL-1.1 loop closure check.

### 4. Silent Action  
An action taken without being declared.  
**Safeguard:** ScribePocket audit.

---

# IX. Completion Protocol

After all structural, procedural, operational, or communication tasks:

1. **Record outputs** in the ScribePocket or Ledger  
2. **Confirm closure** of the active channel  
3. **Return to sovereign baseline**  
4. **Deactivate any invoked modules**  
5. **Reestablish clarity** via PQ-1.0 if needed
