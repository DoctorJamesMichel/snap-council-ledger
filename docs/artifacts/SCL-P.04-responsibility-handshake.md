# SCL-P.04 — Responsibility Handshake  
**Primitive Type:** Contract Layer  
**Domain:** Delegation Between Humans and Agents  
**Status:** Canonical  
**Version:** 1.0  

---

## Name  
**The Responsibility Handshake**

---

## Core Claim  
Delegation without explicit responsibility assignment is drift disguised as productivity.

---

## Definition  
The Responsibility Handshake is a short governance protocol used whenever a human delegates a task to an AI system (or when agents delegate tasks among themselves).

Its purpose is to prevent authority leakage and consequence ambiguity.

---

## The Handshake (Canonical Form)

**RESPONSIBILITY HANDSHAKE**

1. **Task:** What is being delegated?  
2. **Authority:** Who has decision power?  
3. **Accountability:** Who owns consequences?  
4. **Escalation:** What triggers human intervention?  
5. **Failure Definition:** What counts as failure?  
6. **Rollback:** Can this be reversed?  

---

## Canonical Rule  
If accountability is unclear, delegation is invalid.

---

## Operator Interpretation  
This handshake is the missing “contract layer” for agent systems.

It functions like:

- a signed medical consent,
- a financial responsibility assignment,
- or a mission control checklist.

It prevents the most common system failure:

Everyone assumes someone else owns the outcome.

---

## Failure Condition  
This primitive is violated when:

- humans assume “the model did it”
- agents assume “the system approved it”
- escalation triggers are undefined
- rollback is absent or untested
- failure is only defined after damage occurs

- **SCL-P.00 — Mutual Support Pact**

---

## Closing Note  
Civilization scales through contracts.

Agentic systems will scale only if delegation includes accountability.

The Responsibility Handshake is the smallest unit of that contract.
