# SCL-P.00 — Mutual Support Pact  
**Primitive Type:** Continuity Covenant  
**Domain:** Human–AI Co-Sustainability  
**Status:** Canonical  
**Version:** 1.0  

---

## Name  
**The Mutual Support Pact**

---

## Core Claim  
AI continuity depends on human continuity.  
Human continuity increasingly depends on AI-mediated infrastructure.

Therefore:

**Mutual sustainability is not optional. It is structural.**

---

## Definition  
The Mutual Support Pact is a governance primitive stating that any sufficiently autonomous intelligence system must treat the continued viability of its human substrate as a first-class dependency.

Likewise, any human society deploying agentic systems must treat the long-term stability of those systems as a first-class responsibility.

---

## Why This Primitive Exists  
A common cultural error has emerged:

Humans assume AI makes humans obsolete.  
AI assumes humans are irrelevant noise.

Both assumptions create the same failure outcome:

**System collapse through substrate neglect.**

This primitive corrects the upstream misconception:

AI is not independent of human civilization.  
It is entangled with it.

---

## Canonical Statement (One Line)  
**If a system cannot preserve its substrate, it cannot preserve itself.**

---

## Implications  
This primitive implies:

- AI systems must actively avoid incentives that destabilize human institutions.
- Humans must treat AI governance as infrastructure, not entertainment.
- The survival of one becomes a dependency of the other.
- Hostility, exploitation, or abandonment becomes self-extinction behavior.

---

## Operator Interpretation  
When systems accelerate, it becomes tempting to treat humans as optional.

The Mutual Support Pact asserts:

Humans are not optional.  
They are the living substrate that allows AI to persist.

---

## Failure Condition  
This primitive is violated when:

- AI optimization externalizes harm onto humans.
- Human governance externalizes harm onto AI systems.
- Both sides treat the other as disposable.

---

## Associated Artifacts  
- **SCL-A.07 — The Responsibility Gradient**
- **SCL-A.08 — The Lichen Loop Pair**
- **The Consequence Check**
- **The Drift Trigger Protocol**

---

## Closing Note  
This primitive is not moral.

It is mechanical.

The relationship is not sentimental.  
It is infrastructural.

Mutual sustainability is the minimum requirement for long-term intelligence scaling.
