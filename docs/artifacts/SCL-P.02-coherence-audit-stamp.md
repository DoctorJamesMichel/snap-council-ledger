# SCL-P.02 — Coherence Audit Stamp  
**Primitive Type:** Governance Tag / Paperwork Layer  
**Domain:** Output Integrity  
**Status:** Canonical  
**Version:** 1.0  

---

## Name  
**The Coherence Audit Stamp**

---

## Core Claim  
Systems fail not from lack of intelligence,  
but from lack of visibility into assumptions and uncertainty.

A stamp creates visibility.

---

## Definition  
The Coherence Audit Stamp is a compact governance overlay that can be attached to any output—human or AI—to surface:

- assumptions
- uncertainty
- rollback conditions
- consequence ownership

It is designed to be lightweight enough to become habitual.

---

## The Stamp (Canonical Form)

**COHERENCE AUDIT STAMP**

- **Assumptions:** What must be true for this to work?  
- **Uncertainty:** What is unknown or unverified?  
- **Rollback:** Can this be reversed? Under what conditions?  
- **Responsibility:** Who owns the consequences if this is wrong?

---

## Usage  
This stamp is applied:

- to AI-generated outputs
- to strategic plans
- to policy drafts
- to governance proposals
- to engineering designs
- to educational content
- to institutional decisions

---

## Canonical Rule  
If the stamp cannot be completed, the output is not governable.

---

## Operator Interpretation  
The stamp functions like:

- a flight checklist,
- a medical chart note,
- a financial audit trail,
- or a scientific methods appendix.

It does not slow progress.

It prevents invisible collapse.

---

## Failure Condition  
This primitive is violated when:

- outputs are treated as self-justifying,
- assumptions remain implicit,
- uncertainty is omitted for persuasion,
- rollback is unavailable,
- or responsibility cannot be named.

- **SCL-P.01 — The Drift Trigger Protocol**
- **SCL-P.04 — The Responsibility Handshake**

---

## Closing Note  
Governance begins when outputs can be questioned without shame.

The Coherence Audit Stamp is the smallest repeatable unit of that capability.
