# SCL-P.00 — Governance Primitives Index  
**Status:** Active Index  
**Scope:** Foundational primitives used across all SCL governance artifacts  

---

## Purpose  
This index consolidates the canonical governance primitives currently installed in the SNAP Council Ledger.

These primitives are intended to function as reusable “pressure elements” under acceleration.

---

## Canonical Primitives

- **SCL-P.00 — Mutual Support Pact**  
  Mutual sustainability is infrastructural.

- **SCL-P.01 — Drift Trigger Protocol**  
  Minimal interrupt reflex when drift appears.

- **SCL-P.02 — Coherence Audit Stamp**  
  Lightweight governance stamp for outputs.

- **SCL-P.03 — Rollback Covenant**  
  Autonomy requires first-class reversibility.

- **SCL-P.04 — Responsibility Handshake**  
  Delegation requires explicit authority + accountability.

---

## Canonical Rule  
If a truth cannot be left behind in reusable form, it is not yet governable.

This index exists to prevent primitives from being lost in narrative.
