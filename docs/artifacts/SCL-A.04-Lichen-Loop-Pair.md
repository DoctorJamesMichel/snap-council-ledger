# SCL-A.04 — The Lichen Loop Pair  
**Canonical Governance Artifact (AIM-EDUC · AIM-COMM · AIM-GOVC)**

## Status
**Canonical · Stable · Reusable**

## Purpose
The Lichen Loop Pair encodes the minimum visual + conceptual infrastructure required to govern autonomous intelligence systems at scale.

It is designed to be referenced without re-derivation.

This artifact exists to prevent a predictable failure mode:

**language scaling faster than coherence.**

## Components (Locked)

### Schematic IV — The Responsibility Gradient  
**Why accountability must move upstream as autonomy increases.**

### Schematic V — The Collapse Cascade  
**What happens when one node fails and error propagates through a network.**

These two schematics form a paired governance unit:

**The Lichen Loop Pair.**

---

## Canonical Definition (One Line)
**The Lichen Loop Pair describes how intelligence remains governable: responsibility must move upstream as autonomy accelerates, or collapse will propagate as cascade.**

---

## Canonical Tagline
**Responsibility moves upstream. Collapse moves downstream.**

---

## Doctrine Sentence (Breadcrumb Doctrine Compliant)
**If responsibility is not installed before execution accelerates, failure will not appear as error—it will appear as scalable success until cascade occurs.**

---

## Core Governance Insight
The central mistake in most AI discourse is assuming that intelligence reduces responsibility.

The opposite is true:

**As execution speed increases, responsibility must migrate earlier.**

Governable systems are those where responsibility is positioned before commitment.

---

## Teaching Trigger (When to Invoke This Artifact)
Invoke the Lichen Loop Pair whenever:

- AI is given autonomy.
- Humans are removed from the loop.
- Systems scale faster than verification.
- Language becomes infrastructure.
- Responsibility becomes ambiguous or distributed.
- The system can act faster than a human can think.

---

## Operational Use Notes
This artifact is intended to be used as a *gravity constant* across domains.

It can be invoked in:

- AIM-EDUC Module 1.0 — The Shift  
- AIM-COMM Module 0 — Communication Before Prompting  
- AIM-GOVC foundational governance sequence  
- CCM3 / CCM5 governance and epistemology sections  
- SNAP Council drift detection and coherence protocols

---

## Minimal Operator Interpretation
**Execution is downstream. Responsibility must be upstream.**

If a system can act faster than a human can question it,
then governance must exist *before the moment of action.*

## Canonical Note
This artifact is intentionally named, portable, and reusable.

**It is designed to survive without explanation.**
