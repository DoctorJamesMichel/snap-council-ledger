# SCL-P.03 — Rollback Covenant  
**Primitive Type:** Autonomy Safety Standard  
**Domain:** Agentic Systems / Governance Integrity  
**Status:** Canonical  
**Version:** 1.0  

---

## Name  
**The Rollback Covenant**

---

## Core Claim  
Autonomy without rollback is not progress.  
It is irreversible drift.

---

## Definition  
The Rollback Covenant is a governance primitive stating that any system granted autonomy must include first-class rollback capability.

Rollback is not a luxury feature.  
Rollback is the boundary between:

- experimentation and collapse
- governance and runaway execution

---

## Canonical Statement (One Line)  
**If rollback is not first-class, autonomy is not governance-safe.**

---

## Why This Primitive Exists  
As systems accelerate, humans lose timing leverage.

When execution becomes continuous, correction becomes impossible unless rollback is built in.

This primitive asserts:

Responsibility cannot exist where reversibility does not.

---

## Operator Interpretation  
Rollback is the civilizing feature.

It is the difference between:

- a tool you can trust
- and a system you can only fear

---

## Enforcement Rule  
Before autonomy is granted, the system must answer:

- Can changes be reverted cleanly?
- Can previous states be restored without heroics?
- Can provenance be traced?
- Can rollback occur fast enough to stop cascade?

If the answer is unclear, autonomy must not be expanded.

---

## Failure Condition  
This primitive is violated when:

- autonomy increases while rollback disappears
- rollback exists only through manual forensic recovery
- rollback is technically possible but operationally impractical
- rollback is politically or economically discouraged

---

## Closing Note  
Rollback is not a pessimistic feature.

It is the governance expression of humility:

We will be wrong sometimes.  
Therefore, we must remain correctable.
