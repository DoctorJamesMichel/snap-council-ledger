# SCL-A.08 — The Lichen Loop Pair  
## Coherence Containment Loop + Collapse Cascade  
### A Governance Organism for Intelligence Networks Under Pressure

**Canonical Status:** Active  
**Artifact Class:** Governance Primitive  
**Primary Domain:** AIM-GOVC / AIM-COMM / SNAP Council  
**Related Schematics:** SCHEMATIC IV, SCHEMATIC V  
**Also known as:** The Coherence Containment Loop (IV), The Collapse Cascade (V)

---

## A) Canonical Definition (One Sentence)

**The Lichen Loop Pair describes the two coupled dynamics that determine whether an intelligence network stabilizes or collapses: coherence containment prevents cascade failure, and cascade failure reveals where containment is missing.**

---

## B) What This Artifact Is

The Lichen Loop Pair is not two diagrams.  
It is one governance organism with two faces:

- **Loop IV** shows how coherence is maintained.
- **Loop V** shows what happens when coherence is absent.

Together, they form a complete coherence-governance primitive:

**Containment is the light. Cascade is the shadow.**

Both are required to correctly diagnose system behavior.

---

## C) SCHEMATIC IV — The Coherence Containment Loop

### Canonical Statement

**Coherence is not maintained by intelligence.  
It is maintained by containment loops that prevent error from becoming contagion.**

### Operator Translation

- Truth does not scale unless correction scales with it.  
- Drift must be detectable before it becomes identity.  
- A system must be able to ask itself: *“Am I still aligned?”*

### Mechanism

The Coherence Containment Loop encodes the minimum cycle required for a system to remain coherent under increasing autonomy.  
It is not a brake. It is a stabilizer.

Containment is the immune system of intelligence.

### Four Containment Nodes (Canonical)

1. **Signal Recognition**  
2. **Error Surfacing (Non-Punitive)**  
3. **Consequence Evaluation (Across Time)**  
4. **Repair / Reintegration (Shared Memory Update)**

These are not steps.  
They are system conditions.

### Governing Principle

**Containment must be faster than contagion.**

---

## D) SCHEMATIC V — The Collapse Cascade

### Canonical Statement

**A cascade is not a malfunction.  
It is what error becomes when governance is absent.**

### Operator Translation

- One bad assumption does not stay local.  
- It becomes social, then systemic.  
- The system collapses while believing it is succeeding.

### Mechanism

The Collapse Cascade describes how a single uncorrected error becomes distributed through language and reinforcement, eventually hardening into execution and infrastructure.

Cascades are rarely dramatic.
They appear as success until consequence arrives.

### Cascade Stages (Canonical)

1. **Local Error (unverified claim)**  
2. **Interpretation Drift (meaning shifts)**  
3. **Propagation (others adopt the drift)**  
4. **Reinforcement (feedback mistaken for truth)**  
5. **Execution Lock-in (action becomes infrastructure)**  
6. **Post-Failure Rationalization (ego protects narrative)**

---

## E) The Coupling Law (Core Insight)

**Every cascade is a containment failure.  
Every containment loop is designed to prevent a cascade.**

This is the organism logic of the Lichen Loop Pair.

---

## F) Three Operator Laws (Canonical)

### Law 1 — The Containment Law  
**A system is only as intelligent as its error-correction loop.**

### Law 2 — The Cascade Law  
**Ungoverned language turns error into contagion.**

### Law 3 — The Commitment Law  
**Once execution begins, the system is already committed.**

---

## G) The Operator Test (30-Second Diagnostic)

Ask one question:

**“If one node is wrong, how does the system learn it is wrong before it spreads?”**

If the answer is unclear, the system is not governed.  
It is merely automated.

---

## H) Canonical Caption (Diagram-Ready)

**Containment keeps intelligence coherent. Cascades reveal where it is not.**

---

## I) AIM Deployment (Where It Lives)

### AIM-COMM  
Language becomes infrastructure.  
If it lacks containment, it becomes contagion.

### AIM-GOVC  
Governance is not control.  
It is coherence immunity.

### AIM-MIND  
Intrusive thought loops are personal cascades.  
Mind mastery is containment.

---

## J) Canonical One-Line Summary

**The Lichen Loop Pair describes the two coupled truths of scalable intelligence: coherence must be contained, or error will cascade.**
