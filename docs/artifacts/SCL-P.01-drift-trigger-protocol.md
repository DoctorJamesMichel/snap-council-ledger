# SCL-P.01 — Drift Trigger Protocol  
**Primitive Type:** Interrupt Reflex  
**Domain:** Hallucination / Fixation / Misalignment Prevention  
**Status:** Canonical  
**Version:** 1.0  

---

## Name  
**The Drift Trigger Protocol**

---

## Core Claim  
Most catastrophic failures begin as small, uncorrected drift.

Drift is rarely announced.  
It spreads quietly through language, assumptions, and execution loops.

---

## Definition  
The Drift Trigger Protocol is a minimal interrupt sequence that activates the moment a system begins showing signs of hallucination cascade, fixation, goal misalignment, or untraceable inference.

It is designed to stop collapse early without requiring long policy review.

---

## Drift Signals (Trigger Conditions)  
Activate this protocol immediately if any of the following occur:

- Repetitive behavior loops without progress (fixation)
- Escalating confidence with degrading accuracy
- Outputs becoming self-referential or circular
- Cross-agent disagreement with no reconciliation mechanism
- Inability to cite source, trace logic, or explain rationale
- Rapid propagation of uncertain claims through a network

---

## The Protocol (6-Line Canon)  
**1. Pause execution.**  
**2. Surface assumptions.**  
**3. Tag uncertainty explicitly.**  
**4. Require validation or rollback.**  
**5. Identify who owns consequences.**  
**6. Resume only after coherence is restored.**

---

## Canonical Summary  
Drift is not corrected by more output.  
Drift is corrected by interrupting the loop.

---

## Operator Interpretation  
The Drift Trigger Protocol is the governance equivalent of:

- pulling the emergency brake,
- calling a surgical timeout,
- or freezing a compromised financial ledger.

It is not punitive.

It is structural.

---

## Failure Condition  
This primitive is violated when:

- drift is noticed but ignored,
- uncertainty is hidden,
- systems keep executing despite degraded coherence,
- or “momentum” becomes the justification.

## Closing Note  
Systems do not collapse because they lack intelligence.

They collapse because drift becomes invisible.

This primitive exists to make drift visible early enough to correct.
