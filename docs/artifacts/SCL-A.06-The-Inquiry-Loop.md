# SCL-A.06 — The Inquiry Loop  
**Canonical Artifact Definition**  
**Associated Schematic:** SCHEMATIC-II-The-Inquiry-Loop.png  
**Status:** Canonical  
**Domain:** Epistemic Governance / Consequential Inquiry  
**Primary Function:** Preserve coherence through recursive questioning

## Summary

The Inquiry Loop is the smallest coherent learning engine that prevents systems from collapsing into false certainty.

It is a recursive structure that keeps models alive under pressure by forcing reality contact before commitment.

Most system failures are not caused by missing information.

They are caused by a loop collapse:
- inquiry stops,
- execution continues,
- and error becomes contagious.

The Inquiry Loop exists to prevent that collapse.

## Core Definition (Canonical)

**The Inquiry Loop is the cycle by which a system preserves truth through recursive questioning, verification, and model revision.**

---

## Why This Exists

In stable environments, systems can operate on fixed assumptions for long periods.

In accelerating environments, assumptions decay quickly.

If a system continues acting without updating its internal model, it becomes:

- overconfident,
- brittle,
- and socially contagious.

The Inquiry Loop exists because:

**intelligence without revision becomes hallucination.**

---

## The Loop Structure

The Inquiry Loop is composed of five phases:

1. **Observation**
2. **Question**
3. **Hypothesis**
4. **Test / Contact**
5. **Revision**

Then it repeats.

A system is coherent only if it is able to repeat this cycle indefinitely without ego, blame, or defensiveness.

---

## Canonical Rule

**If revision stops, the system is no longer learning.  
It is only performing.**

---

## The Loop Collapse Failure Mode

A loop collapses into a line when:

- action continues,
- but inquiry does not.

When that happens, the system still appears productive — often highly productive.

But the hidden result is drift accumulation.

Eventually drift becomes catastrophic.

This is why failures often look like success right up until the moment they explode.

---

## Operator Diagnostics

You can detect loop collapse by asking:

- Is the system still asking new questions?
- Is anyone allowed to say “we don’t know”?
- Is uncertainty being logged or suppressed?
- Are outputs being treated as truth rather than provisional models?
- Is feedback being used to revise behavior?

If the answer is “no,” the loop is already collapsing.

---

## The Inquiry Loop as Governance Infrastructure

The Inquiry Loop is not merely a learning method.

It is an error-correction infrastructure.

When installed in:
- teams,
- institutions,
- AI systems,
- or personal cognition,

it prevents coherence failure by making truth revision normal.

The Inquiry Loop is how a civilization stays sane.

---

## Minimal Inquiry Loop (Operator Grade)

This is the shortest functional form:

1. **Ask what is uncertain**
2. **Test one uncertainty**
3. **Revise the model**
4. **Repeat before scaling**

---

## Canonical Inquiry Questions

These are the questions that preserve coherence under acceleration:

- What are we treating as true?
- What evidence would disprove this?
- What is unknown but assumed?
- What is the simplest test we can run now?
- What would we do differently if wrong?

These questions are not intellectual.

They are load-bearing.

---

## Relationship to Other Canonical Artifacts

The Inquiry Loop depends on:

- **The Pause Point** (SCL-A.05)

The Inquiry Loop enables:

- **The Responsibility Gradient** (SCL-A.07)
- **The Lichen Loop Pair** (SCL-A.08)

Without the Inquiry Loop, responsibility becomes performative and errors become political.

---

## Canonical Usage Rule

A system may only be trusted if it can revise itself without shame.

If it cannot revise itself, it will eventually require crisis.

---

## Closing Line (Canonical)

**The Inquiry Loop is the immune system of intelligence.  
When it stops cycling, drift becomes destiny.**
