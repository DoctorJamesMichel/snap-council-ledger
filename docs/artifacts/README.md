# SNAP Council Ledger — Artifacts (Canonical Governance Objects)

This folder contains the **canonical written artifacts** of the SNAP Council Ledger.

Artifacts are not essays.

They are **enduring operational objects** designed to preserve coherence across time, scale, and system complexity.

Artifacts are meant to be:

- taught,
- referenced,
- reused,
- carried into institutions,
- embedded into AI systems,
- and invoked during real-world decision-making.

Artifacts are the Ledger’s **breadcrumb layer**.

They exist to prevent drift.

## Canonical Rule

**If an artifact cannot be left behind in a reusable form, it is not yet governable.**

---

## Relationship to Schematics

Many artifacts have a corresponding visual schematic stored in:

`/docs/assets/schematics/`

Schematics are not decorative.

They are governance artifacts expressed visually.

---

## Artifact Naming Convention

Artifacts follow this format:

`SCL-A.##-Artifact-Name.md`

Where:

- **SCL** = SNAP Council Ledger  
- **A** = Artifact series  
- **##** = sequential artifact number

# Canonical Artifact Index (A-Series)

| ID | Artifact Title | Primary Function | Status |
|----|---------------|------------------|--------|
| **A.04** | [The Lichen Loop Pair Card](SCL-A.04-Lichen-Loop-Pair-Card.md) | Defines coherence containment vs collapse cascade trajectories | Canonical |
| **A.05** | [The Pause Point](SCL-A.05-The-Pause-Point.md) | Establishes the interrupt threshold before commitment | Canonical |
| **A.06** | [The Inquiry Loop](SCL-A.06-The-Inquiry-Loop.md) | Defines recursive questioning as coherence preservation | Canonical |
| **A.07** | [The Responsibility Gradient](SCL-A.07-The-Responsibility-Gradient.md) | Moves accountability upstream as autonomy accelerates | Canonical |
| **A.08** | [The Lichen Loop Pair](SCL-A.08-The-Lichen-Loop-Pair.md) | Defines the paired system destinies: containment vs cascade | Canonical |

## Canonical Chain (Required Sequence)

These artifacts form a complete governance chain:

1. **The Pause Point**  
2. **The Inquiry Loop**  
3. **The Responsibility Gradient**  
4. **The Lichen Loop Pair**

This chain is intended to function as a minimum viable governance substrate for scalable intelligence systems.

## Design Standard for Future Artifacts

Every artifact should contain:

- Summary
- Core definition (canonical)
- Operator interpretation
- Failure modes prevented
- Usage rule(s)
- Relationship to other artifacts
- Closing canonical line

Artifacts should remain **text-first**, platform-independent, and suitable for:

- GitHub
- CCM appendix integration
- AIM course deployment
- Substack publication adaptation
- AI governance scaffolding

## Status

This folder is under active expansion.

All additions must preserve canonical continuity.
