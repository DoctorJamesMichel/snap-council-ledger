# SNAP Council Ledger — Artifacts

This folder contains **canonical governance artifacts**: portable, reusable structures designed to preserve coherence across time, scale, and system complexity.

Artifacts are not essays.

They are **enduring operational objects**—meant to be:
- taught,
- referenced,
- reused,
- carried into institutions,
- embedded into AI systems,
- and invoked during real-world decision-making.

Artifacts are the Ledger’s **breadcrumb layer**.

They exist to prevent drift.

## Artifact Design Standard

An artifact must satisfy all of the following:

1. **Portable**
   - usable without requiring the full Ledger context

2. **Reusable**
   - applicable across domains (AI, governance, education, personal regulation)

3. **Stable**
   - resistant to reinterpretation drift

4. **Operational**
   - capable of guiding real decisions, not merely describing ideas

5. **Consequence-Aware**
   - designed for systems where speed amplifies harm

## Canonical Principle

**If a truth cannot be left behind in a reusable form, it is not yet governable.**

This is the Breadcrumb Doctrine applied to governance design.

## Notes

Artifacts may originate from:
- Substack posts,
- AIM course modules,
- SNAP Council field notes,
- experimental governance dialogues,
- or real-world operator failures.

However, once promoted into this folder, an artifact is considered **canonical** unless explicitly deprecated.

---

## Status

This folder is expected to grow steadily.

Artifacts should remain numbered and titled consistently using the format:

`SCL-A.XX — Artifact Title`

Where `XX` is a stable sequence number.
