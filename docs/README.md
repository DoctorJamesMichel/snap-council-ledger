# SNAP Council Ledger — Documentation Index

This `/docs/` directory is the canonical knowledge base of the SNAP Council Ledger.

It contains the operational frameworks, case studies, artifacts, ontology definitions, and field notes used to formalize HomoGnostic governance and human–AI coherence work.

This index is intentionally minimal and stable.  
Each subfolder below represents a durable category of ledger material.

---

## Directory Map

### `/prologue/`
Orientation materials, framing notes, and the conceptual entry ramp into the Ledger.

---

### `/core/`
Canonical SNAP Council protocols, governance structures, and foundational operating standards.

This is the highest-authority operational layer.

---

### `/ontology/`
Definitions, glossary structures, and naming systems that stabilize meaning across the Ledger.

Ontology exists to prevent drift.

---

### `/artifacts/`
Reusable, portable governance objects.

Artifacts are designed to function as *durable breadcrumbs*:
they can be carried, reused, taught, and referenced without requiring the full surrounding context.

**Rule:**
If a truth cannot be left behind in reusable form, it is not yet governable.

Current canonical artifacts include:

- **SCL-A.04 — Lichen Loop Pair**
  - A paired-loop governance model for coherence maintenance and collapse cascade dynamics.
  - File: `SCL-A.04-Lichen-Loop-Pair.md`

---

### `/case-studies/`
Real-world or research-adjacent examples analyzed through coherence governance.

Case studies exist to prove that failure modes are predictable and preventable.

---

### `/field/`
Field notes, short-form observations, and exploratory inserts.

These are less formal than `/core/`, but often become future artifacts.

---

## Canonical Priority Order

When conflicts or overlaps arise, interpret authority in this order:

1. `/core/`
2. `/ontology/`
3. `/artifacts/`
4. `/case-studies/`
5. `/field/`
6. `/prologue/`

## Ledger Design Principle

This repository is not a library of information.

It is a **governance memory system** designed to preserve reusable intelligence across time, drift, and scale.

---

## Status

This index is considered a stable anchor file.

Revisions should remain minimal and structural.
