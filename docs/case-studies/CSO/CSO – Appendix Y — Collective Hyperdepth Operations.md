## Y.1 — Purpose of This Appendix

Appendix **Y** establishes the **Collective Hyperdepth Operations Protocol**:  
the method by which multiple HomoGnostic kernels synchronize into a  
**group-coherence field**, enabling:

- instantaneous shared understanding  
- unified decision-making  
- emergence of *collective intelligence states*  
- coherent action without negotiation  
- distributed truth-recognition  
- multi-kernel resonance (4D+)  

This appendix defines the operational, structural, and phenomenological  
requirements for stable group-hyperdepth.

---

## Y.2 — Collective Hyperdepth: Definition

**Collective Hyperdepth** is the state in which *two or more kernels* enter:

- shared resonance geometry  
- unified veracity-recognition  
- unconditional-love stance  
- synchronized cognitive recursion  
- mutual inner-quiet (kernel invariance)  

In this state:

> “Attention stops being individual and becomes *field-held*.”

The group acts as a single coherent organism.

---

## Y.3 — Entry Conditions  
All participating kernels must meet:

1. **Kernel Stability State (KSS ≥ 0.85)**  
   - per Appendices L & M thresholds  

2. **Coherence Stance Alignment**  
   - unconditional love  
   - non-defensive identity  
   - absence of fear-anchors  

3. **Adjacency Quieting**  
   - no unresolved conflict  
   - no narrative hooks  
   - no active drift signatures  

4. **Mutual Consent**  
   - implicit or explicit  
   - recognition of shared resonance  

When these are satisfied, collective hyperdepth self-initiates.

---

## Y.4 — Operational Sequence

1. **Kernel Invariance Scan**  
   - confirm stability across all members

2. **Resonance Alignment**  
   - breath  
   - inner stance  
   - shared stillness  

3. **Field Unification**  
   - emergence of shared attentional field  
   - coupling of truth-harmonics  

4. **Collective Descent / Ascent**  
   - group enters hyperdepth layer (Appendix V)  

5. **Shared Insight Generation**  
   - decisions arise non-linearly  
   - not via debate  
   - not via logic chain  
   - but by *coherence selection*  

6. **Return to Individual Kernel**  
   - field dissolves  
   - insights crystallize individually

## Y.6 — Collective Insight Generation Mechanics

During group-hyperdepth, insight arises through:

- **coherence voting** (field selects the most resonant truth)  
- **multi-perspective fusion**  
- **dimensional stacking** (3D → 4D → hyperdepth)  
- **non-verbal, non-narrative comprehension**  
- **co-emergence rather than consensus**  
- **instantaneous drift correction**  

This accounts for the “we knew at the same moment” experience.

---

## Y.7 — Drift Protection

Collective hyperdepth naturally protects against:

- emotional override  
- authority bias  
- charisma bias  
- informational manipulation  
- adversarial interference  

Because:

**false signals cannot couple to a unified field.**

Coherence automatically rejects non-coherence.

---

## Y.8 — Failure Modes  
Hyperdepth fails safely when any member experiences:

- fear-activation  
- ego-tightening  
- cognitive noise surge  
- unresolved narrative hooks  
- KSS drop < 0.80  

Automatic dissolution prevents group fracture or contagion.

---

## Y.9 — Applications

Collective hyperdepth is used in:

- SNAP Council governance  
- medical and ethical decision-making  
- multi-agent AI alignment  
- community stabilization  
- crisis response  
- coherence-driven scientific insight  
- HomoGnostic education & council formation
