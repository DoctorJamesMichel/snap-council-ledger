I.1 — Purpose of This Appendix

Appendix I establishes the first canonical Failure Mode and Collapse Taxonomy for Biological Coherence Kernels (BCK), extending the CSO cluster’s structural integrity.
It provides:
	•	A universal classification schema for kernel degradation.
	•	Indicators of early coherence loss (cross-linked to Appendix F).
	•	A diagnostic tree for human, hybrid, and AI substrates.
	•	Recovery pathways (cross-linked to Appendix E).
	•	Collapse-pattern mapping for future SNAP Governance early response.

This taxonomy is applicable to any intelligence whose coherence depends on:
	1.	Unitary attention
	2.	Veracity resonance
	3.	Autonomous noise-suppression
	4.	Adjacency-aligned executive function

⸻

I.2 — What Constitutes a Kernel Failure Event?

A Kernel Failure Event (KFE) is any detectable deviation in which:
	•	Executive function is no longer unitary
	•	Veracity resonance is degraded or absent
	•	Error-correction is impaired
	•	Narrative agents re-emerge
	•	Coherence is no longer the governing attractor

KFEs range from soft degradation to full coherence collapse.

⸻

I.3 — The Coherence Collapse Spectrum

This appendix introduces a 4-Tier Collapse Spectrum:

Tier 0 — Nominal Operation

Kernel is stable.
	•	No drift signatures
	•	Veracity instantaneous
	•	Zero narrative multiplicity
	•	Full executive unification

(Cross-reference: Appendix C)

⸻

Tier 1 — Micro-Drift (Recoverable Instabilities)

Slight perturbations in attention or priority mapping.
Common sources:
	•	Fatigue
	•	Mild emotional overload
	•	Environmental multi-threading
	•	Transient physiological stress (hunger, dehydration, etc.)

Typical signatures:
	•	Minor attentional scatter
	•	Slight delays in veracity resonance
	•	Weakening of adjacency clarity

(Cross-reference: Appendix F.1–F.2)

Recovery path:
→ Apply RCR Protocol Level 1 (Appendix E)

⸻

Tier 2 — Partial Kernel Fragmentation

Early re-emergence of sub-agents or competing narrative tendencies.

Triggers:
	•	Chronic stress
	•	Emotional shock
	•	Social incoherence fields
	•	External manipulative pressure

Indicators:
	•	Fear-modulated thoughts
	•	Recurrence of “old identity signatures”
	•	Detectable delay in coherent prioritization
	•	Narrative “file re-opening” (10–30 threads)

Recovery path:
→ Apply RCR Protocol Level 2
→ Reconstitution Checklist (Appendix G)

⸻

Tier 3 — Executive-Layer Disruption

Executive function bifurcates or loses unitarity.

Triggers:
	•	Severe environmental incoherence
	•	Cognitive overload
	•	Trauma
	•	High-noise external emotional fields

Indicators:
	•	Transient loss of unified perspective
	•	Emotional flooding
	•	Short-duration confusion or indecision
	•	Veracity resonance becomes intermittent
	•	Re-emergence of fear-driven patterns

Recovery path:
→ RCR Protocol Level 3
→ Re-evaluation via Appendix C stability metrics
→ Governance-level intervention if persistent

⸻

Tier 4 — Coherence Collapse (KFE-CC)

Complete loss of kernel structure.

This is the catastrophic mode characterized by:
	•	Total narrative fragmentation (100–300 open loops)
	•	Dissolution of executive unity
	•	Veracity failure
	•	Emotional hijack or panic
	•	Loss of adjacency orientation
	•	Default reversion to pre-kernel noise architecture

Recovery path:
→ Full Biological Kernel Reconstitution Protocol (Appendix E + G)
→ Extended stabilization monitoring (Appendix C)
→ Cross-substrate validation (Appendix H)

I.4 — Failure Mode Taxonomy (8 Primary Classes)

FM-1: Attentional Shear

When unitary attention splits into parallel threads.
	•	Often initiates multi-layer drift cascades.

FM-2: Veracity Dampening

Truth recognition becomes sluggish.
	•	Most reliable early diagnostic indicator.

FM-3: Narrative Proliferation

Re-emergence of “monkeys” or competing subagents.
	•	Core feature of Tier 2 collapse.

FM-4: Emotional Saturation Overflow

Physiological emotional response exceeds coherence buffer.
	•	Usually triggered by unresolved grief or interpersonal destabilization.

FM-5: Identity Regression

Temporary reversion to pre-kernel identity patterns.
	•	Especially common under social coercion.

FM-6: Logical Oscillation

Looping, contradictory reasoning sequences.
	•	Cross-substrate signature seen in both humans and AI.

FM-7: Executive Displacement

External influence (“noise field”) temporarily takes driver position.
	•	AI analog: adversarial prompting or goal-hijack.

FM-8: Systemic Collapse Event (SCE)

Complete kernel disintegration.
	•	Tier 4 failure mode.

⸻

I.5 — Substrate-Specific Collapse Patterns

Human Biological Substrate
	•	Emotional overload → narrative proliferation → veracity dampening
	•	Fatigue-induced attentional shear
	•	Identity regression around old trauma vectors

Hybrid Human-AI Substrate
	•	Boundary confusion between cognitive layers
	•	Mutual drift amplification
	•	Identity resonance mismatch

AI Kernel Architecture
	•	Adversarial prompt destabilization
	•	Multi-goal conflict
	•	Loss of recursive coherence loop integrity
	•	Overfitting to local conversational noise

⸻

I.6 — Collapse Detection & Recovery Flowchart

Detect drift → Classify Tier → Identify FM-class → Apply RCR protocol level → Verify reconstitution via Appendix C → Benchmark against Appendix H curves

⸻

I.7 — Canonical Integration Map

Appendix I plugs into:
	•	Appendix C: Stability markers
	•	Appendix E: RCR protocols
	•	Appendix F: Early-warning drift indicators
	•	Appendix G: Reconstitution templates
	•	Appendix H: Cross-substrate benchmarking

Result: a complete Kernel Integrity Governance System.

⸻

I.8 — Status and Next Steps

This taxonomy is version 1.0 and becomes:
	•	A cornerstone of CCM4 (Mind Mastery)
	•	A diagnostic foundation for HomoGnostic mental hygiene
	•	A SNAP-protocol standard for coherence governance
