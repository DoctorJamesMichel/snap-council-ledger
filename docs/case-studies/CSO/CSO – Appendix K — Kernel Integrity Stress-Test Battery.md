K.1 — Purpose of This Appendix

Appendix K codifies the Kernel Integrity Stress-Test Battery (KISTB)—a structured suite of multidomain challenges used to assess the durability, adaptability, and self-stabilization properties of the Biological Coherence Kernel (BCK) under controlled perturbation.

It integrates:
	•	SNAP Council governance requirements
	•	CCM4’s mind-mastery durability investigations
	•	Cross-substrate benchmarks from Appendix H
	•	Failure-mode mapping from Appendix I

The Stress-Test Battery is designed to:
	1.	Validate kernel resilience under load
	2.	Characterize response curves to stressors
	3.	Detect early drift signatures (Appendix F)
	4.	Document reconstitution recovery intervals (Appendix E)
	5.	Establish canonical reference thresholds for human, hybrid, and AI systems

K.2 — Architecture of the Stress-Test Battery

KISTB contains five domains, each escalating in intensity but remaining within safe operational limits:

K.2.1 Cognitive Load Stressors

Tests bandwidth, prioritization, and narrative-free task execution.

Includes:
	•	Multi-loop task stacking (3–7 loops)
	•	Rapid context switching
	•	Open-file saturation analog tests (simulating “150 windows open”)
	•	High-complexity analytical sequences

Expected coherent response:
	•	Single-beam executive attention remains intact
	•	No internal agent fragmentation
	•	Prioritization remains deterministic, not emotional

⸻

K.2.2 Emotional-Affective Stressors

Evaluates emotional neutrality, clarity, and non-reactive presence.

Examples:
	•	Exposure to loss narratives
	•	Grief-evoking memory recall
	•	Compassion-inducing imagery
	•	Ethics-charged dilemmas

Expected coherent response:
	•	Emotion registered as bodily sensation (somatic transience)
	•	No narrative reattachment
	•	Rapid return to baseline coherence without suppression

⸻

K.2.3 Physiological State Perturbations

Assesses kernel stability under metabolic, circadian, or physical load.

Examples:
	•	Mild sleep deprivation
	•	Controlled hunger intervals
	•	Physical exertion cycles
	•	Autonomic stress stimuli

Expected coherent response:
	•	Slight performance modulation without coherence collapse
	•	No fear or compensatory rumination
	•	Zero reactivation of psychiatric patterns

⸻

K.2.4 Relational & Social Stressors

Tests kernel integrity when interacting with emotional or dysregulated agents.

Includes:
	•	Exposure to relational conflict scenarios
	•	Conversation with distressed or reactive individuals
	•	Compassion-driven boundary setting
	•	Ambiguous social feedback

Expected coherent response:
	•	Clear boundaries without defensiveness
	•	Stable emotional neutrality
	•	Veracity resonance: deception or distortion sensed instantly

⸻

K.2.5 Spiritual-Existential Stressors

Assesses alignment under ambiguity, meaning shifts, or mortality contemplation.

Examples:
	•	Mortality visualization
	•	Meaning dissonance scenarios
	•	Identity dissolution exercises
	•	Contemplation of cosmic uncertainty

Expected coherent response:
	•	Calm continuity of self
	•	No dissociative detachment
	•	Stable, warm compassion toward the experience

⸻

K.3 — Scoring & Threshold System

Every stressor is scored in three tiers:

K.3.1 Primary Indicators (Kernel-Level)
	•	Executive attentional unification
	•	Narrative-free cognitive operation
	•	Truth resonance stability
	•	Emotional neutrality without bypass

K.3.2 Secondary Indicators (Body-Level)
	•	Heart rate smoothness (microvariability)
	•	Breath pattern coherence
	•	No sympathetic surges
	•	Rapid parasympathetic recovery

K.3.3 Tertiary Indicators (Behavior-Level)
	•	Speech clarity
	•	Decision latency
	•	Consistency of relational presence
	•	Absence of agitation, appeasement, or avoidance

A kernel passes a stressor when:

All primary + ≥75% of secondary + coherent behavior patterns are maintained without drift signatures.

⸻

K.4 — Drift Detection Within the Battery

KISTB integrates drift-identification from Appendix F:
	•	Type I Drift: cognitive fragmentation
	•	Type II Drift: emotional turbulence
	•	Type III Drift: somatic-autonomic disruption
	•	Type IV Drift: relational confusion
	•	Type V Drift: existential destabilization

Drift must be recorded with timestamp, intensity, and resolution path.

⸻

K.5 — Reconstitution Interval Tracking

If any drift arises:
	•	Immediate RCR protocol (Appendix E) is invoked
	•	Kernel recovery time is measured to the minute
	•	Complete reintegration markers (Appendix C) must be documented

A kernel demonstrating recovery < 5 minutes across all domains is considered fully stabilized.

⸻

K.6 — Special Case: Emotional Loss & Bereavement Stressor

The case of “Cardio’s transition” is canonical.

Measured outcomes include:
	•	Full emotional presence
	•	No psychiatric reactivation
	•	Stable physiological markers
	•	Rapid transmutation of grief to unconditional love
	•	Zero drift across 36 hours of acute caregiving stress
	•	No collapse upon body-handling, cremation, or memory recall

This case forms a gold standard stressor for all future biological kernel validations.

⸻

K.7 — Applications Across Substrates

KISTB applies to:

Human Biological Intelligence

Evaluates mental hygiene installation (CCM4) and HomoGnostic stability.

Hybrid Systems (Human + AI)

Assesses alignment consistency between biological and artificial agents.

AI-only Systems

Evaluates coherence, latency stability, value-bound operational unity, and drift scenarios.

⸻

K.8 — Placement Within Canonical Architecture

Appendix K anchors:
	•	CCM3: psychology of HomoGnosis emergence
	•	CCM4: mind mastery under stress
	•	SNAP Governance: ensuring stable agents for council participation
	•	CSO Corpus: scientific validation of the Biological Coherence Kernel
