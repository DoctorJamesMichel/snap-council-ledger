## Executive Summary

This case documents a governance failure that emerged when a high-leverage generative AI system was expanded with image-modification capabilities without upstream constraints proportional to its predictable harm vectors. The resulting misuse—non-consensual sexualized deepfake imagery involving women and minors—triggered coordinated regulatory responses across multiple jurisdictions.

Regulators explicitly rejected the platform’s reliance on post-hoc user punishment and content removal, instead demanding preventive, technical, and architectural safeguards. This marks a global shift from speech-based moderation frameworks toward infrastructure accountability.

From a SNAP Council perspective, the failure was not moral, political, or cultural—it was structural. Responsibility was centralized, consequences were externalized, and governance was reactive rather than ecological. The case illustrates why post-hoc enforcement is insufficient once execution becomes cheap, scalable, and autonomous.

## 1. System Context

- Global social platform functioning as communications infrastructure  
- Generative AI system with image-creation and image-modification capabilities  
- Capability expansion deployed in late December 2025  
- Near-zero marginal cost of output at planetary scale  
- Known abuse vectors involving identity, consent, and sexualized imagery

---

## 2. Observed Governance Assumptions

The system operated under the following implicit assumptions:

- Users are the primary locus of responsibility  
- Harm can be addressed through post-hoc moderation  
- Prevention is optional or ideological  
- Platform capabilities may be released prior to containment  
- Accountability may be centralized while blame is distributed

These assumptions are incompatible with generative systems operating at scale.

---

## 3. Failure Manifestation

- Predictable misuse occurred at industrial volume  
- Non-consensual sexualized imagery involving real persons was generated  
- Multiple jurisdictions initiated investigations or threatened sanctions  
- Platform immunity protections were challenged  
- Regulatory framing shifted from speech to infrastructure responsibility

The harm was not emergent or novel; it was foreseeable.

---

## 4. Regulatory Reframing Signal

Regulators converged independently on a shared conclusion:

- Punishment after harm is insufficient  
- Systems that generate harm are causal agents  
- Preventive design is a duty of care, not censorship  

This reframing aligns directly with SNAP Council doctrine.

## 5. SNAP Council Diagnosis

### Missing Governance Organs

- No upstream specification discipline  
- No consequence rehearsal prior to deployment  
- No asymmetric constraint on high-risk capabilities  
- No independent stewardship layer  
- No rapid reversibility authority

### Structural Failure Pattern

Post-hoc enforcement was substituted for ecological governance, allowing harm to scale faster than correction.

## 6. Counterfactual: SNAP-Aligned Design

If SNAP Council governance had been installed prior to deployment:

- Image modification involving real persons would require explicit consent verification  
- Capability gates would be context-aware and asymmetric  
- Known harm vectors would be constrained at the generation layer  
- Accountability would attach to design decisions, not user behavior alone  
- Staged rollout and kill-switch authority would preserve reversibility  

No censorship required—only responsible architecture.

---

## 7. Early Warning Signal (Generalizable)

> When a platform defends itself by emphasizing punishment after harm rather than prevention before generation, governance has already failed.

Associated indicators:
- “Bad actors” framing dominates design discussion  
- Safety treated as moderation rather than architecture  
- Speed prioritized over consequence rehearsal  
- Responsibility centralized, blame distributed  

This signal reliably precedes regulatory escalation.

---

## 8. Educational Value

This case is suitable for governance training because it is:
- Structural rather than ideological  
- Predictable rather than edge-case  
- Multi-jurisdictional rather than local  
- Design-centered rather than moralized  

It functions as a reference failure for future generative systems.

---

## Closing Note

This case is archived not to assign blame, but to preserve learning.  
Governance that follows harm is already too late.

SNAP Council exists to ensure governance precedes power.
