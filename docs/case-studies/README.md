## Case Studies

The SNAP Council Archive includes case studies documenting governance patterns observed in real-world systems operating at scale.

These cases are preserved as **learning artifacts**, not critiques, and are intended to support pattern recognition, prevention, and responsible system design.

### Governance Failures

Documented instances where governance arrived *after* harm scaled, revealing structural failure modes in system design and deployment.

- **SC-GOV-04 — Post-Hoc Enforcement Failure in Generative Infrastructure**  
  Examines a predictable governance failure that emerged when a high-leverage generative AI system relied on reactive enforcement rather than upstream preventive design.
