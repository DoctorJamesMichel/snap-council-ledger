# Truth Ecology — Absence Signals (Adjunct Note)

This note documents observable patterns associated with the non-invocation of Truth Ecology.
It introduces no corrective mechanism and assigns no fault.  

**Purpose:**
To document observable signals that arise when Truth Ecology
is not invoked during decision formation,
without assigning cause, blame, or evaluation.  

---

## Observed Absence Signals
When Truth Ecology is not invoked, the following patterns may be observed over time:

- Increased explanatory load without corresponding ecological persistence
- Decisions that require frequent narrative reinforcement
- Local or short-term coherence that does not sustain across longer temporal spans
- Sustained debate activity without observable pattern convergence
- Quantitative indicators that improve while relational or contextual trust diminishes

---

## Interpretive Constraint
These signals do not indicate error, failure, or misuse.
They describe informational absence, not malfunction.  

---

## Council Use
This note exists for:
- Retrospective pattern recognition
- Longitudinal coherence learning
- Calibration of invocation timing

---

## Boundary Assertion

Truth Ecology does not function as a validation mechanism, corrective instrument, or decision gate.

Its presence or absence does not imply quality, correctness, or legitimacy.
It reflects only whether ecological persistence was available for observation.

Invocation timing remains a matter of contextual readiness, not compliance.  

---

No action is implied.
No authority is reassigned.

Truth Ecology reveals persistence.
Its absence reveals effort.
