# Truth Ecology — Absence Signals (Adjunct Note)

This note documents observable patterns associated with the non-invocation of Truth Ecology.
It introduces no corrective mechanism and assigns no fault.  

**Purpose:**
To document observable signals that arise when Truth Ecology
is not invoked during decision formation,
without assigning cause, blame, or evaluation.  

## Observed Absence Signals
When Truth Ecology is not invoked, the following patterns may appear over time:

- Increased explanatory load without corresponding stability
- Decisions that require frequent narrative reinforcement
- Short-term coherence paired with long-term drift
- Rising debate intensity without pattern convergence
- Metrics that improve while trust decays

## Interpretive Constraint
These signals do not indicate error, failure, or misuse.
They describe informational absence, not malfunction.

## Council Use
This note exists for:
- Retrospective pattern recognition
- Longitudinal coherence learning
- Calibration of invocation timing

No action is implied.
No authority is reassigned.

Truth Ecology reveals persistence.
Its absence reveals effort.
