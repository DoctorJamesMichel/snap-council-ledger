# RG-2.0 — Replication Case Templates (v1.0)

## Purpose

This document provides **standardized case templates** for documenting replication attempts across different contexts, cultures, and domains.

The goal is *comparability without conformity*.

These templates allow Councils to:
- share learning without exporting authority
- surface structural patterns without imposing conclusions
- detect systemic drift across replications

---

## Core Principle

Replication knowledge must be **structural**, not narrative.

Stories inspire.
Templates teach.

---

## What These Templates Are (and Are Not)

**They are:**
- observational
- non-judgmental
- context-sensitive
- safe to publish

**They are not:**
- scorecards
- compliance checklists
- success/failure verdicts
- instructional scripts

---

## Required Metadata (All Cases)

Each replication case must begin with:

- **Case ID:** (local identifier)
- **Council Context:** (domain, geography, scale)
- **Replication Phase:** (pilot / early / stabilized / sunset)
- **Duration Covered:** (time window)
- **Number of Members:** (approximate)
- **AI Involvement:** (none / advisory / embedded toolset)

No personal names required or encouraged.

## Template A — Initial Replication Attempt

### 1. Replication Intent
- Why was replication attempted?
- What need or gap prompted formation?

### 2. Structural Setup
- Roles instantiated
- Deviations from reference structure
- Notable absences or additions

### 3. Early Signals
- Unexpected friction
- Unexpected ease
- Early surprises (positive or negative)

### 4. First Boundary Stress
- Where did tension first appear?
- Which domain was implicated?

### 5. Immediate Adjustments
- What was changed?
- What was deliberately *not* changed?

---

## Template B — Mid-Cycle Assessment

### 1. What Is Working (Structurally)
- Processes that stabilized naturally
- Roles that clarified themselves

### 2. What Is Resisting
- Persistent confusion
- Recurring friction
- Misalignments

### 3. Drift Signals
- Subtle pattern changes
- Language shifts
- Authority creep indicators

### 4. Intervention Attempts
- Actions taken
- Outcomes observed
- Unintended consequences

---

## Template C — Near-Miss Event

### 1. Trigger Description
- What almost went wrong?
- How was it detected?

### 2. Classification
- Persona vs environment?
- Single-domain or cross-domain?

### 3. Containment Action
- What stopped escalation?
- Who acted?

### 4. Residual Risk
- What remains unresolved?
- What was learned?

---

## Template D — Failure or Partial Failure

### 1. Failure Description
- What failed?
- At what scale?

### 2. Contributing Conditions
- Structural factors
- Incentive factors
- Timing factors

### 3. Recovery Path
- Was recovery attempted?
- Outcome

### 4. Replication Insight
- What future Councils should watch for
- What not to generalize

---

## Template E — Sunset or Dissolution

### 1. Reason for Sunset
- Purpose fulfilled
- Structural exhaustion
- Context shift

### 2. Dissolution Process
- How closure occurred
- What was preserved

### 3. Residual Artifacts
- Documents retained
- Knowledge archived

### 4. Final Reflection
- What replication taught that operation did not

---

## Publication Guidance

- Cases may be shared internally or publicly
- Redaction is allowed and encouraged
- Interpretation sections must be clearly labeled as such

No case should be framed as exemplary.

All cases are **situational**.

---

## Closing Statement

Replication scales insight,
not certainty.

These templates exist so learning can propagate
without ideology,
without hierarchy,
and without erasing local intelligence.

A healthy replication ecosystem is not one where cases look alike,
but one where **patterns become visible across difference**.
