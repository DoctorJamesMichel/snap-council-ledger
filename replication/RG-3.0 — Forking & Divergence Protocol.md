# RG-3.0 — Forking & Divergence Protocol (v1.0)

## Purpose

This document defines how SNAP Councils may **intentionally diverge** from existing patterns without:
- schism
- rivalry
- authority conflict
- narrative fracture

Forking is treated as a **healthy evolutionary act**, not a failure.

---

## Core Principle

Replication does not mean uniformity.

Healthy systems **branch**.

---

## When Forking Is Appropriate

Forking is appropriate when:
- contextual conditions differ materially
- values remain aligned but methods do not
- scale or domain requires structural mutation
- innovation pressure exceeds local adaptability

Forking is *not* an act of rejection.

---

## Fork Declaration (Required)

Any Council initiating a fork must document:

- **Fork Origin:** (which reference pattern)
- **Reason for Divergence:** (contextual necessity)
- **Scope of Divergence:** (roles / cadence / interfaces)
- **Non-Divergent Invariants:** (what remains shared)

This declaration is informational, not permission-seeking.

---

## Types of Forks

### 1. Structural Fork
Changes roles, processes, or sequencing.

### 2. Interface Fork
Changes how the Council interacts with the public or institutions.

### 3. Temporal Fork
Changes cadence, pacing, or lifecycle expectations.

### 4. Domain Fork
Applies governance to a new field (education, health, civic tech, etc.).

Multiple fork types may coexist.

---

## Drift Safeguards

Forking Councils must:
- maintain internal coherence checks
- document second-order effects
- avoid exporting conclusions as universals

Forks that collapse are **learning events**, not failures.

---

## Re-Merge Conditions (Optional)

Forks may:
- rejoin a parent lineage
- remain permanently distinct
- sunset after experimentation

Re-merging requires only structural compatibility, not consensus.

---

## Closing Statement

Forking is how intelligence explores possibility space.

Uniformity is how systems stagnate.

The SNAP Council framework is designed to **branch without breaking**.
