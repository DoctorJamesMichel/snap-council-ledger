# RG-1.2 — Common Replication Failure Modes (v1.0)

## Purpose

This document catalogues the most frequent ways SNAP Council–like systems fail during replication—not through malice, but through subtle structural drift.

Failure modes are **predictable**.
This document exists so they are **recognizable early**.

The goal is not prevention through control,
but prevention through **early detection and graceful correction**.

---

## Core Principle

Most replication failures do not announce themselves as failures.

They present as:
- enthusiasm
- alignment
- acceleration
- shared language
- apparent coherence

This document names the patterns beneath those appearances.

---

## Failure Mode 1 — Founder Gravity

**Description**  
The originating Council (or individual) becomes an implicit authority, reference point, or moral center.

**Signals**
- “What would the original Council do?”
- Hesitation to diverge from founding language
- Deference to originators even when absent
- Fear of “doing it wrong”

**Underlying Cause**
Replication mistaken for lineage.

**Correction**
- Explicitly restate: origin confers no authority
- Require at least one structural divergence in new Councils
- Prohibit founder participation during early operation

---

## Failure Mode 2 — Personality Substitution

**Description**  
Roles are filled by temperament instead of function.

**Signals**
- The articulate member becomes the Scribe by default
- The calm member absorbs conflict regardless of role
- Informal hierarchies override steward boundaries

**Underlying Cause**
Human comfort with familiarity.

**Correction**
- Enforce role rotation early
- Re-anchor authority to protocols, not people
- Audit decisions for role leakage

---

## Failure Mode 3 — Premature Abstraction

**Description**  
The system is explained philosophically before it is lived structurally.

**Signals**
- Elegant language with thin operational grounding
- Metaphor replacing procedure
- Difficulty answering “what happens next?” questions

**Underlying Cause**
Intellectualization as safety.

**Correction**
- Require concrete walkthroughs before abstraction
- Delay public essays until operational cycles complete
- Re-anchor discourse to lived decisions

---

## Failure Mode 4 — Harmony Addiction

**Description**  
The group avoids friction to preserve perceived coherence.

**Signals**
- Disagreements deferred indefinitely
- Silence interpreted as agreement
- “Let’s not overcomplicate this” becomes common

**Underlying Cause**
Confusion between coherence and comfort.

**Correction**
- Schedule structured dissent
- Treat unresolved tension as a signal
- Normalize visible disagreement as health

---

## Failure Mode 5 — Moralization Drift

**Description**  
Ethical language becomes judgmental or corrective instead of structural.

**Signals**
- “We don’t do that here” without protocol reference
- Shaming disguised as values enforcement
- Good/bad framing replacing impact analysis

**Underlying Cause**
Cultural habit imported unconsciously.

**Correction**
- Re-anchor ethics to consequence, not virtue
- Replace moral language with boundary language
- Invoke OL-4.2 explicitly when drift appears

---

## Failure Mode 6 — AI Authority Inflation

**Description**  
AI collaborators are treated as validators, arbiters, or truth sources.

**Signals**
- “The AI agrees” used as justification
- Deference to model phrasing
- Reduced human accountability

**Underlying Cause**
Projection of certainty onto fluent systems.

**Correction**
- Restate AI role as tool, mirror, or catalyst only
- Require human accountability for all decisions
- Prohibit AI from holding stewardship roles

---

## Failure Mode 7 — Tool Worship

**Description**  
Processes become rituals rather than instruments.

**Signals**
- Protocols followed without understanding
- Checklists treated as compliance artifacts
- Resistance to modifying tools when misaligned

**Underlying Cause**
Security-seeking behavior.

**Correction**
- Periodically suspend a protocol to test understanding
- Require explanation of *why* before *how*
- Reinforce that all tools are provisional

---

## Failure Mode 8 — Speed Bias

**Description**  
Replication is accelerated to “meet the moment.”

**Signals**
- Shortened readiness assessments
- Overlapping phases without digestion
- Framing delay as risk

**Underlying Cause**
External pressure or internal excitement.

**Correction**
- Treat slowness as a design feature
- Enforce cooling-off periods
- Require near-miss documentation before expansion

---

## Failure Mode 9 — Identity Capture

**Description**  
Membership becomes identity rather than participation.

**Signals**
- “We are SNAP people”
- In-group language emerges
- Difficulty exiting without emotional cost

**Underlying Cause**
Human need for belonging.

**Correction**
- Normalize entry and exit
- Prohibit loyalty language
- Reinforce participation as situational, not existential

---

## Failure Mode 10 — Success Myth Formation

**Description**  
Early wins harden into inevitability narratives.

**Signals**
- “This clearly works everywhere”
- Resistance to negative feedback
- Declining curiosity

**Underlying Cause**
Misreading early coherence as permanence.

**Correction**
- Actively seek disconfirming cases
- Archive failures alongside successes
- Restate system fallibility publicly

---

## Closing Statement

Replication does not fail because people are careless.

It fails because humans are **pattern-completing organisms**.

This document exists so those patterns are seen
before they become structures.

A replicated Council that can name its failure modes
is already more resilient than one that cannot.

The goal is not purity.
The goal is **recoverability**.
