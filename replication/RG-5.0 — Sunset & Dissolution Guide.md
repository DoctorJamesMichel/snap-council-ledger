# RG-5.0 — Sunset & Dissolution Guide (v1.0)

## Purpose

This document defines how a SNAP Council may:
- pause
- sunset
- dissolve
- or intentionally conclude its work

without:
- failure narratives
- moralization
- institutional residue
- or mythic afterlife

A Council that ends well strengthens the field.

---

## Core Principle

Endings are structural events, not judgments.

A Council is not meant to exist indefinitely.
It exists **until its function is complete, suspended, or no longer coherent**.

---

## Legitimate Reasons for Sunset

A Council may sunset when:
- its founding context no longer exists
- its purpose has been fulfilled
- energy or participation has naturally declined
- the work has migrated into institutions, culture, or practice
- continuation would produce inertia rather than insight

None of these constitute failure.

---

## Forms of Conclusion

### 1. Pause
- Temporary suspension
- No active deliberation
- Minimal maintenance only
- May resume without reconstitution

### 2. Sunset
- Intentional completion
- Final synthesis produced
- No expectation of return

### 3. Dissolution
- Active termination
- Roles released
- Records archived
- Identity formally retired

The chosen form must be declared explicitly.

---

## Required Sunset Declaration

Any Council concluding must produce a brief declaration including:
- **Reason for conclusion**
- **Form of conclusion** (pause / sunset / dissolution)
- **What was learned**
- **What remains unresolved**
- **Where artifacts are archived**

This declaration is descriptive, not justificatory.

---

## Stewardship of Artifacts

Upon conclusion:
- All documents enter read-only status
- No further revisions occur
- Forking is permitted only with explicit recontextualization
- No member retains interpretive authority by default

Artifacts belong to the field, not to individuals.

---

## Role Release Protocol

When a Council ends:
- All roles are formally released
- No role carries forward by assumption
- Future Councils must reassign roles intentionally

Identity persistence is a primary source of drift.

---

## Prohibitions

A concluding Council must not:
- mythologize its existence
- claim lineage authority
- anoint successors
- declare itself foundational or permanent

There are no elder Councils.

---

## Emotional Hygiene Clause

Grief, pride, relief, or ambivalence may occur.
None require institutional expression.

The Council does not process emotions collectively at sunset.
Individuals may do so privately.

---

## Closing Statement

A Council that cannot end
was never governing—only persisting.

The highest signal of coherence
is the ability to conclude
without residue, regret, or demand for continuation.

End cleanly.
The field remains.
