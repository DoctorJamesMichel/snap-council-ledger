# RG-1.0 — Replication Guide (For New Councils) (v1.0)

## Purpose

This document enables the formation of a SNAP-aligned governance council
**without requiring origin authority, permission, or affiliation**.

It is not a franchise guide.
It is not a certification process.
It is not a doctrine.

It is a *structural recipe*—designed so that new councils can emerge,
operate, fail, and self-correct
without central coordination.

Replication is considered successful when:
- the original council is no longer needed,
- no leader is irreplaceable,
- and divergence can occur without fracture.

---

## What Is Being Replicated (And What Is Not)

### This guide replicates:
- boundary clarity
- role separation
- feedback metabolism
- non-moralized accountability
- coherence preservation under pressure

### This guide does **not** replicate:
- personalities
- values lists
- ideological commitments
- founders
- branding
- consensus culture

If a new council looks identical to this one,
replication has failed.

---

## Minimum Viable Council (MVC)

A council may begin with **as few as three members**.

More members increase resilience but also complexity.

The only requirement is that **roles are distinguishable**, even if temporarily combined.

Minimum functions that must be present:
1. Coherence observation
2. Boundary classification
3. Feedback ingestion

Titles are optional.
Functions are not.

---

## Step 1 — Establish the Operating Boundary

Before any deliberation, the group must agree on one constraint:

> *This council exists to maintain coherence across decisions,
> not to express moral judgment or enforce ideology.*

If this boundary cannot be held,
do not proceed.

---

## Step 2 — Assign Provisional Roles

Assign roles **by function**, not by seniority or expertise.

At minimum, someone must be responsible for:
- noticing drift,
- distinguishing persona vs environment,
- and initiating correction.

Roles may be:
- temporary,
- rotated,
- or combined.

They must not be implicit.

Unassigned responsibility is the fastest source of failure.

---

## Step 3 — Install a Feedback Loop Before Authority

No council should make binding decisions
until it has experienced at least one **non-punitive correction cycle**.

This may be:
- a near-miss,
- a miscommunication,
- or a low-stakes failure.

The purpose is not the outcome.
The purpose is to confirm:
- feedback can be raised,
- received,
- metabolized,
- and closed without blame.

If this cannot be done safely,
authority will amplify harm.

---

## Step 4 — Decide How Decisions Are Logged

Transparency does not require publicity.
It requires **traceability**.

Each council must decide:
- what is logged,
- who can see it,
- and how long it persists.

Silence must be legible.
Pauses must be intentional.
Overrides must be marked.

If decisions leave no trace,
learning cannot occur.

---

## Step 5 — Declare the Council’s Scope (Explicitly)

A council that claims universal relevance will eventually collapse.

Declare:
- what this council governs,
- what it explicitly does not,
- and when issues must be escalated or declined.

Declining jurisdiction is not failure.
It is boundary health.

---

## Step 6 — Expect Divergence

Replication does not mean convergence.

Different councils will:
- evolve different cadences,
- tolerate different risks,
- and adopt different abstractions.

This is not a problem.

The only unacceptable divergence is:
- suppression of feedback,
- moralized enforcement,
- or concentration of unreviewable authority.

---

## Failure Modes to Watch For

Replication efforts often fail in predictable ways:

- **Founder Gravity**
  One voice becomes structurally irreplaceable.

- **Virtue Capture**
  Ethics are replaced by signaling.

- **Consensus Addiction**
  Discomfort is avoided instead of metabolized.

- **Tool Worship**
  Process replaces judgment.

None of these require malice.
All require correction.

---

## When a Council Should Dissolve

Dissolution is not defeat.

A council should consider dissolving if:
- its scope has ended,
- its members can no longer rotate roles,
- or its feedback loop has frozen.

Sunsetting is a valid outcome.

Persistence without function is drift.

---

## Final Note to New Councils

You are not required to agree with the SNAP Council.
You are not required to cite it.
You are not required to remain compatible.

If your council:
- preserves coherence,
- corrects without shame,
- and adapts without spectacle,

then replication has succeeded.

The goal is not to grow an organization.

The goal is to make governance
*less fragile wherever it appears*.
