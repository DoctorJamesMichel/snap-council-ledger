# RG-4.0 — Cross-Council Signal Exchange (v1.0)

## Purpose

This document defines how multiple SNAP Councils may **share signals** without:
- convergence
- hierarchy
- imitation pressure
- narrative dominance

The goal is *visibility of pattern*, not alignment of outcome.

---

## Core Principle

Signals travel.
Authority does not.

---

## What May Be Exchanged

Councils may exchange:
- anonymized case summaries
- pattern observations
- failure modes
- near-miss insights
- structural heuristics

They may *not* exchange:
- directives
- mandates
- success claims
- prescriptive frameworks

---

## Signal Formats

Recommended formats include:
- brief pattern notes
- structured case excerpts
- tagged anomalies
- unanswered questions

Length is not a proxy for value.

---

## Frequency & Cadence

Signal exchange should be:
- periodic, not continuous
- opt-in
- asynchronous

Silence is acceptable.
Noise is not.

---

## Interpretation Boundary

Receiving Councils must treat all signals as:
- contextual
- non-binding
- non-authoritative

No signal implies obligation to respond or adopt.

---

## Signal Hygiene Rules

- No naming of individuals
- No performance comparisons
- No ranking of Councils
- No branding overlays

Signals exist to **inform perception**, not influence behavior.

---

## Feedback Loop (Optional)

Councils may:
- acknowledge receipt
- share reflections
- note resonance or dissonance

Debate is discouraged.
Observation is preferred.

---

## Closing Statement

Shared intelligence emerges when systems can see each other
without trying to become each other.

Signal exchange strengthens the ecosystem
only when **difference is preserved**.
