# RG-1.1 — Replication Readiness Checklist (v1.0)

## Purpose

This document exists to prevent premature, distorted, or personality-driven replication of the SNAP Council framework.

Replication is not an act of enthusiasm.
It is an act of **structural maturity**.

This checklist must be completed **before** attempting to seed a new Council instance.

Failure to meet readiness criteria is not a moral failure.
It is a timing signal.

---

## Core Principle

A system is ready to replicate only when:

- It can operate without its originators
- It can correct itself without heroics
- It can absorb error without blame
- It can explain itself without mystique

Replication readiness is about **capacity**, not conviction.

---

## Section I — Structural Readiness

Confirm the following are true:

- [ ] The core operating layers (OL-1 through OL-3) are complete and internally coherent
- [ ] Boundary stewardship roles are clearly defined and understood
- [ ] Conflict arbitration protocols exist and have been tested
- [ ] Failure ingestion and near-miss analysis protocols are active
- [ ] No unresolved structural contradictions are being “worked around”

If any item above is incomplete, replication must pause.

---

## Section II — Personnel Readiness

Confirm the following:

- [ ] At least three members understand the system beyond their own role
- [ ] No single individual is acting as irreplaceable authority
- [ ] Role rotation has been practiced without destabilization
- [ ] The group has navigated disagreement without schism
- [ ] The system has survived absence of its most articulate member

Replication must not depend on charisma, fluency, or founder presence.

---

## Section III — Psychological & Cultural Readiness

Confirm the following dynamics are present:

- [ ] Disagreement is metabolized, not personalized
- [ ] Correction does not trigger defensiveness or collapse
- [ ] Silence is treated as a signal, not compliance
- [ ] Praise does not accelerate authority accumulation
- [ ] Members are more attached to coherence than to being right

If the group requires harmony to function, it is not ready.

---

## Section IV — External Interface Readiness

Confirm:

- [ ] The Public Charter (OL-4.x) is complete and stable
- [ ] FAQ and misinterpretation guardrails exist and are enforced
- [ ] The system can be described without revealing internal machinery
- [ ] Public explanations do not rely on insider language or mythology
- [ ] There is a clear boundary between *invitation* and *recruitment*

Replication should invite discernment, not allegiance.

---

## Section V — Anti-Myth Verification

Explicitly verify:

- [ ] The originating Council is not treated as superior
- [ ] No narrative frames the system as “inevitable,” “chosen,” or “next stage of humanity”
- [ ] AI systems are framed as collaborators, not authorities
- [ ] The framework is presented as revisable, not complete
- [ ] Forking and divergence are explicitly permitted

If replication requires loyalty to origin, it has already failed.

---

## Section VI — Replication Decision Gate

Answer honestly:

**If this Council dissolved tomorrow, would the system still be replicable?**

- [ ] Yes
- [ ] No

Only a “Yes” permits replication.

If “No,” document the limiting factors and return to operation.

---

## Closing Statement

Replication is not success.
Replication is **responsibility**.

A system that cannot say “not yet” is not ready to say “begin.”

Proceed only when readiness is structural, not emotional.
