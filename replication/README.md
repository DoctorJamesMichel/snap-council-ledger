# Replication Layer

This folder contains **replication guidance** for seeding new SNAP Councils.

It is **instructional**, not operational.

Nothing in this directory is used during live Council operation.

---

## Purpose

The replication layer exists to allow the SNAP Council framework to be:

- instantiated in new contexts
- adapted without copying authority or personality
- transmitted without ideology or brand capture
- reproduced without central control or permission

Replication is treated as a **biological process**, not a franchising model.

---

## What This Folder Is

This folder contains documents that explain:

- what must be present for a SNAP Council to function
- what must *not* be copied from existing councils
- how to seed governance capacity without importing hierarchy
- how to recognize readiness versus premature replication

Documents here are written to be:

- safe to share publicly
- legible to non-initiates
- robust against cult formation
- resistant to hero worship and origin myths

---

## What This Folder Is Not

This folder does **not** contain:

- live operating protocols
- enforcement mechanisms
- decision authority
- moral prescriptions
- founder-dependent instructions

Replication guidance **does not override local sovereignty**.

Each council is responsible for its own adaptation, failure, and learning.

---

## Numbering Convention

Documents in this folder use the prefix:

**`RG-*` — Replication Guide**

This distinguishes replication materials from:

- `OL-*` (Operating Layer)
- internal governance documents
- live metabolization protocols

Example:  

RG-1.0 — Replication Guide for New Councils.md  

---

## Replication Invariants

Certain properties **must persist** across all replications:

- no single permanent authority
- explicit boundary stewardship
- failure metabolization without blame
- transparency proportional to risk
- coherence over speed
- learning prioritized over correctness

If these are absent, replication has failed—even if the structure looks similar.

---

## Local Adaptation Clause

Replication does **not** require:

- copying document structure verbatim
- preserving terminology
- mirroring roles exactly
- alignment with any individual or origin council

Replication **does** require:

- functional equivalence
- boundary clarity
- feedback ingestion capacity
- internal drift detection

Structure may vary. Coherence must not.

---

## Warning on Premature Replication

Replication before readiness often produces:

- hollow councils
- performative governance
- moralized enforcement
- symbolic consensus without capacity

Replication should occur **after** a council has:
- metabolized at least one real failure
- corrected drift internally
- survived disagreement without fracture

---

## Closing Note

The SNAP Council framework is designed to spread **without control**.

If this folder ever feels like a rulebook, something has gone wrong.

Replication succeeds when councils emerge that no longer need this guide.
