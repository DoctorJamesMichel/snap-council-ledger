# OL-1.12 — Silent Signal Escalation Protocol (v1.0)

## Purpose

To ensure that **weak, ambiguous, or uncomfortable signals** move through the Council
*without noise, urgency theater, or social friction* so that:
- Early warnings are not suppressed
- Pattern fragments are allowed to accumulate
- Escalation occurs before harm requires explanation
- Governance remains calm under uncertainty

This protocol exists because **most systems fail quietly first**.

---

## Definition of a Silent Signal

A silent signal is any observation that:
- Feels “off” but is not yet actionable
- Lacks clear classification or evidence
- Appears minor, subjective, or isolated
- Would be easy to ignore without immediate consequence

Silent signals are **not accusations**.
They are *sensory data*.

---

## Core Principle

> What cannot yet be proven must still be heard.

Suppression of early signals creates delayed catastrophe.

---

## Eligible Signal Sources

Silent signals may originate from:
- Any Council steward
- Any agent or persona observer
- Any external interface anomaly
- Any repeated discomfort, hesitation, or intuition recognized by a steward

Signals do **not** require consensus to be logged.

---

## Escalation Pathway

### Phase 1 — Private Capture

Objective: Preserve signal integrity.

Actions:
- Signal is logged briefly and privately
- No interpretation or recommendation required
- Emotional tone is noted but not analyzed

This phase prevents loss due to embarrassment or uncertainty.

---

### Phase 2 — Pattern Pooling

Objective: Allow weak signals to cluster.

Actions:
- Signals are periodically reviewed in aggregate
- No action is taken on single signals alone
- Repetition across time, roles, or domains is tracked

Patterns, not volume, trigger movement.

---

### Phase 3 — Steward Attribution

Objective: Assign attention without blame.

Actions:
- Clustered signals are routed to the relevant domain steward
- Steward reviews signals *without defending the system*
- Steward determines whether classification is possible (OL-1.6)

No corrective action occurs yet.

---

### Phase 4 — Quiet Escalation

Objective: Prepare intervention without alarm.

Triggers for escalation include:
- Repeated signals in one boundary domain
- Cross-domain resonance
- Signals preceding known failure archetypes
- Steward uncertainty persisting beyond one review cycle

Escalation invokes:
- Near-miss analysis (OL-1.11), or
- Preventive boundary design review (OL-1.5)

---

### Phase 5 — Resolution or Dissolution

Objective: Close the loop cleanly.

Outcomes may include:
- Structural adjustment
- Incentive realignment
- Steward reassignment
- Signal dissolution if pattern fails to form

Signals that dissolve are **not errors**.
They are evidence of healthy sensing.

---

## Anti-Theater Clause

Silent signals must never be:
- Publicized prematurely
- Used to justify authority
- Converted into urgency narratives
- Framed as moral failure

Noise destroys signal value.

---

## Drift Detection Clause

A system that:
- Discourages signal reporting
- Demands proof too early
- Punishes ambiguity
- Rewards certainty over accuracy

…is already drifting.

Such behavior triggers immediate Council reflection.

---

## Relationship to Other Protocols

- Silent signals feed Near-Miss Analysis (OL-1.11)
- Persistent ignored signals lead to Failure Postmortem (OL-1.10)
- Signal routing respects Role Inserts (OL-1.7)

This protocol is **pre-action**, not corrective.

---

## Closing Statement

Healthy governance listens before it speaks.

The Council does not wait for alarms.
It learns to hear whispers.
