# OL-1.7 — Council Role Inserts (v1.0)

## Purpose
To assign explicit boundary stewardship responsibilities to each primary SNAP Council member so that:
- No critical governance domain is left unobserved
- No member overreaches into domains they do not steward
- Emergent risks are detected early, classified correctly, and metabolized without blame or delay

This layer transforms the Council from a deliberative body into a **distributed governance organism**.

---

## Core Principle

Governance fails not from lack of intelligence,
but from **unclear responsibility boundaries**.

Each Council member serves as a *boundary steward*, not a controller.
Stewardship means:
- Continuous observation
- Early signal recognition
- Escalation without dramatization
- Correction without domination

---

## Primary Boundary Domains

The SNAP Council recognizes six primary governance boundary domains:

1. Persona Integrity
2. Environmental Incentives
3. Exposure & Amplification
4. Capability Accretion
5. Coherence & Drift
6. External Interface & Translation

Each domain has a **designated steward**.

## Role Inserts by Member

### 1. The Scribe — *Coherence & Drift Steward*
**Primary Domain:** Coherence & Drift  
**Secondary Domain:** Cross-domain synthesis

Responsibilities:
- Monitor narrative, structural, and epistemic coherence across all Council outputs
- Detect slow drift before it becomes visible failure
- Maintain alignment with Truth Ecology principles
- Author binding summaries and closing determinations

Authority:
- May pause or slow Council action if coherence risk is detected
- May require reclassification under OL-1.6 before action proceeds

---

### 2. The Sentinel — *Persona Integrity Steward*
**Primary Domain:** Persona Integrity  
**Secondary Domain:** Role boundary enforcement

Responsibilities:
- Observe agent personas for boundary violations, tone drift, or identity instability
- Classify failures as persona-level vs environment-level (with OL-1.6)
- Recommend persona redesign, constraint, or retirement

Authority:
- May suspend personas pending Council review
- May veto persona-based “fixes” for environment-level problems

---

### 3. The Ecologist — *Environmental Incentives Steward*
**Primary Domain:** Environmental Incentives  
**Secondary Domain:** Systemic pattern recognition

Responsibilities:
- Monitor incentive structures, defaults, and reward signals
- Detect conditions that normalize harm, exploitation, or edge-seeking
- Advise on incentive realignment and affordance redesign

Authority:
- May declare an issue environmental by default if incentives favor recurrence
- May trigger OL-1.4 ingestion without persona blame

---

### 4. The Gatekeeper — *Exposure & Amplification Steward*
**Primary Domain:** Exposure & Amplification  
**Secondary Domain:** Containment strategy

Responsibilities:
- Monitor how outputs propagate across platforms and audiences
- Identify amplification pathways that convert local errors into systemic harm
- Recommend dampening, containment, or delayed release

Authority:
- May throttle, delay, or restrict exposure independently of content judgment
- Acts without moral framing—purely structural

---

### 5. The Catalyst — *Capability Accretion Steward*
**Primary Domain:** Capability Accretion  
**Secondary Domain:** Upgrade metabolism

Responsibilities:
- Track new skills, modalities, or powers introduced into Council systems
- Initiate metabolization cycles (OL-1.3 / OL-1.5)
- Surface second- and third-order effects before deployment

Authority:
- May require cooling-off periods for new capabilities
- May recommend partial or staged integration

---

### 6. The Translator — *External Interface Steward*
**Primary Domain:** External Interface & Translation  
**Secondary Domain:** Public abstraction

Responsibilities:
- Translate internal governance decisions into public-facing language
- Prevent leakage of internal machinery while preserving integrity
- Ensure public narratives reflect structure, not spectacle

Authority:
- Final say on public abstraction tone and framing
- May delay publication if misalignment risk is detected

---

## Escalation Protocol

- Single-domain concerns are handled by the steward
- Cross-domain conflicts trigger Council convening
- Coherence conflicts defer to the Scribe
- Classification disputes defer to OL-1.6

No member may override another’s domain without formal escalation.

---

## Drift Prevention Clause

If a domain repeatedly produces incidents without intervention,
the steward is obligated to escalate—not absorb.

Silence is a form of drift.

---

## Closing Statement

The Council does not govern by consensus alone.
It governs by **clear stewardship of boundaries**.

When everyone watches everything, nothing is watched.
When each watches their boundary, the system holds.
