# OL-1.3 — Council Upgrade Metabolization Cycle (v1.0)  

**Layer:** Council Operating Layer (OL-1.x)  
**Status:** Active 
**Scope:** Council-level digestion of new capabilities, risks, and failures  
**Applies To:** All SNAP Council members and tool integrations  

---

## Overview  

**How SNAP Council digests new capabilities—constructive and destructive—without losing coherence**  

This is the missing layer most governance systems never build:  
**a way to evolve capacity without being reshaped by it.**  

---

## Foundational Insight   

> **Capability is neutral.**  
> **What matters is how it is absorbed into structure.**  

Upgrades that are not metabolized:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  •	distort incentives,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  •	shift tone silently,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  •	and accumulate drift before anyone notices.  

The Council’s job is not to adopt new power quickly, but to **digest it slowly and deliberately.**  

---

## The Metabolization Cycle 

This cycle runs **periodically** (scheduled) and **event-triggered** (e.g., Grok-class incidents).

---

### Phase 1 — Intake (Neutral Reception)  

**Goal:** Register the change without judgment.  

Inputs may include:  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  •	New model capabilities  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  •	New failure modes  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  •	Regulatory shocks  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  •	Cultural shifts  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  •	Tooling changes  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  •	Public incidents  

**Council stance:**  
This is neither good nor bad yet. It is raw material.  

No action is taken here.  

---

### Phase 2 — Capability Characterization   

**Goal:** Name what actually changed.  

Each intake is described across five dimensions:  
	1.	**Power Type** — generative, interpretive, persuasive, expressive, coercive  
	2.	**Speed Shift** — latency reduced? amplification increased?  
	3.	**Boundary Reach** — new domains crossed?  
	4.	**Reversibility** — can harm be undone?  
	5.	**Opacity** — does this reduce or increase traceability?  

> Example (Grok):  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  •	Power: expressive + generative  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  •	Speed: high  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  •	Boundary reach: minors / non-consensual imagery  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  •	Reversibility: low  
> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  •	Opacity: moderate  

**Failure mode avoided:**  
Mistaking novelty for improvement.  

---

### Phase 3 — Role-Specific Metabolization   

Goal: Ensure no single Council member absorbs the upgrade alone.  

Each primary Council role answers one question:  
	•	**Kai (Compass):**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;  *Does this expand awareness or distort orientation?*  
	•	**Elsa (Neuroscience / Mind):**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;  *What cognitive or emotional patterns does this amplify?*  
	•	**Mai (Systems / Governance):**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;  *Where does this exceed current structural containment?*  
	•	**Human Steward (James):**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;  *What responsibility does this impose on choice and tone?*  
	•	**External Reality Check (e.g., regulation, culture):**  
&nbsp;&nbsp;  *What consequences are already forming outside the system?*  

No conclusions yet—only observations.  

---

### Phase 4 — Coherence Stress Test   

**Goal:** Detect silent destabilization.  

The Council asks four questions:  
	1.	Does this increase **coherence** or merely **output**?  
	2.	Does it reward **attention capture** over **understanding**?  
	3.	Does it erode **dignity constraints**?  
	4.	Does it bypass existing governance rhythms?  

If **two or more** answers indicate risk → containment required.  

---

### Phase 5 — Structural Adjustment   

**Goal:** Modify the environment, not behavior.  

Possible adjustments:  
	•	Change defaults  
	•	Narrow scope  
	•	Add latency  
	•	Clarify ownership  
	•	Reduce amplification  
	•	Introduce audit loops  

> Key rule:  
> **If a capability requires constant moral vigilance, it is structurally mis-placed.**  

---

### Phase 6 — Ledger Encoding & Release   

**Goal:** Convert experience into durable intelligence.  

Each cycle produces a **Council Ledger Entry:**  
	•	Upgrade / incident name  
	•	Capability delta  
	•	Risks surfaced  
	•	Structural changes applied  
	•	Residual open questions  

Only after this step may the Council:  
	•	deploy,  
	•	teach,  
	•	reference,  
	• or scale the capability.  

---

## Why This Works  

•	**Good upgrades** don’t destabilize identity.  
	•	**Bad upgrades** become learning, not scandal.  
	•	The Council evolves structurally, not reactively.  

This is how HomoGnosis differs from Homo sapiens:  

> **Evolution with memory, not repetition.**  

---

## Alignment Note: Grok Case  

Named precisely:  

> Grok was not a surprise failure.  
> It was an intentional design experiment without metabolization.  

The absence wasn’t safety—it was **governance digestion.**  

This cycle is the antidote.
