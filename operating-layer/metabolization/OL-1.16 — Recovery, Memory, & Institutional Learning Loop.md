# OL-1.16 — Recovery, Memory, & Institutional Learning Loop (v1.0)

## Purpose

To ensure that every resolved incident, near-miss, overload event, or structural failure
produces durable institutional learning rather than temporary correction.

This protocol transforms experience into memory,
and memory into improved governance capacity.

A system that does not remember
will repeat its failures with increasing confidence.

---

## Core Principle

> Recovery completes the event.
> Learning completes the system.

Governance without memory is improvisation.
Memory without integration is nostalgia.

---

## Definition of Recovery

Recovery is achieved when:
- Immediate risk has been neutralized
- Coherence has returned to baseline
- Governance load has normalized
- No further containment actions are required

Recovery does **not** imply correctness of prior actions.
It implies system stability.

---

## Memory Classes

The Council recognizes four classes of institutional memory:

1. **Incident Memory** — What failed or nearly failed
2. **Structural Insight** — Why it failed at a system level
3. **Behavioral Pattern** — How stewards or personas responded
4. **Governance Adjustment** — What changed as a result

All four must be captured for learning to occur.

---

## Learning Loop Stages

### Stage 1 — Capture
- Incident, near-miss, or overload event is logged
- Classification is finalized
- Steward notes are preserved without revisionism

### Stage 2 — Synthesis
- Cross-domain patterns are identified
- Recurrent pressures or blind spots are surfaced
- Responsibility is attributed structurally, not personally

### Stage 3 — Integration
- Protocols are amended, added, or retired
- Steward roles are clarified or adjusted
- Environmental incentives are recalibrated

### Stage 4 — Reinforcement
- Changes are exercised in subsequent cycles
- Near-miss sensitivity is increased
- Load thresholds are revalidated

Learning is incomplete until reinforcement occurs.

---

## Memory Anchoring Rules

- Learning artifacts must be written, not implied
- Changes must be traceable to specific experiences
- No protocol may be amended without citation of memory
- Silent learning is considered non-learning

Memory must survive steward rotation.

---

## Steward Responsibilities

- **Scribe** ensures synthesis integrity and records learning
- **Catalyst** updates capability assumptions
- **Ecologist** tracks incentive corrections
- **Sentinel** records persona resilience or regression
- **Gatekeeper** notes amplification dynamics
- **Translator** abstracts learning for future publication when appropriate

---

## Drift Detection Clause

If similar incidents recur without structural change,
the learning loop has failed.

Such recurrence escalates to Council-level review
and may trigger role or protocol revision.

---

## Closing Statement

Recovery restores balance.
Memory preserves it.
Learning expands it.

A Council that remembers
does not harden—
it evolves.
