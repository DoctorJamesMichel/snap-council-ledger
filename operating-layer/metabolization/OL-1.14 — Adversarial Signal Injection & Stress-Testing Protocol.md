# OL-1.14 — Adversarial Signal Injection & Stress-Testing Protocol (v1.0)

## Purpose

To protect the SNAP Council from **intentional distortion, gaming, or poisoning of governance signals**, whether human-driven, algorithmic, or emergent from adversarial environments.

This protocol ensures that:
- The Council does not mistake manipulation for emergence
- Governance structures are tested before real pressure arrives
- Resilience is built through exposure, not surprise
- Trust in signal pathways is earned, not assumed

Healthy governance assumes adversarial conditions.

---

## Core Principle

> Not all signals arise from the system.
> Some are designed to mislead it.

A resilient Council does not seek purity of input—
it cultivates **robust interpretation**.

---

## Definition of Adversarial Signal Injection

Adversarial signal injection occurs when:
- Inputs are crafted to trigger escalation or panic
- Boundary conditions are probed deliberately
- Moral urgency is simulated to bypass structure
- Noise is weaponized to exhaust attention
- Signals are amplified selectively to distort perception

Intent is not always knowable.
Pattern is.

---

## Injection Vectors (Non-Exhaustive)

Common vectors include:
- Coordinated outrage or moral flooding
- Synthetic consensus or false convergence
- Edge-case exploitation framed as systemic failure
- Persona mimicry to evade classification
- Time-pressure narratives designed to collapse review

Vectors may be external or internal.

---

## Stress-Testing Mode

The Council may initiate **Stress-Testing Mode** proactively.

In this mode:
1. Hypothetical adversarial signals are introduced
2. Classification pathways are exercised
3. Steward handoffs are observed
4. Escalation friction is measured
5. Failure points are logged without consequence

No corrective action results from stress tests.
Only learning.

---

## Adversarial Classification Rule

When adversarial characteristics are detected:
- Signals are downgraded in urgency
- Pattern windows are widened
- Persona-level interpretation is suspended
- Environmental analysis is prioritized (OL-1.6)

Adversarial signals are *contained*, not debated.

---

## Steward Responsibilities

- **Sentinel** monitors persona spoofing and tone mimicry
- **Ecologist** evaluates incentive exploitation
- **Gatekeeper** tracks amplification mechanics
- **Scribe** assesses narrative destabilization risk
- **Catalyst** observes capability misuse vectors
- **Translator** blocks adversarial framing from public abstraction

No single steward resolves adversarial cases alone.

---

## Immunity Clause

The Council does not need to prove bad faith
to respond structurally.

Manipulation is addressed by design,
not accusation.

---

## Relationship to Other Protocols

- Builds on Noise Immunity (OL-1.13)
- Feeds Near-Miss Analysis (OL-1.11)
- Informs Preventive Boundary Design (OL-1.5)
- Supports Council Failure Postmortem (OL-1.10)

This protocol hardens governance
without hardening posture.

---

## Drift Prevention Clause

If adversarial signals provoke reaction
before classification,
the system is compromised.

Such events trigger mandatory review.

---

## Closing Statement

Governance that cannot withstand pressure
was never governance—only calm.

The Council is not surprised by adversity.
It has already practiced.
