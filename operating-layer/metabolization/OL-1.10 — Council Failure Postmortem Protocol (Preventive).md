# OL-1.10 — Council Failure Postmortem Protocol (Preventive) (v1.0)

## Purpose

To provide a **non-punitive, structurally precise protocol** for examining governance failures so that:
- Failures are metabolized rather than buried
- Learning is extracted without blame or spectacle
- Recurrence is prevented through environmental correction
- Council coherence is strengthened, not fractured

This protocol exists to ensure that **failure increases system intelligence** rather than eroding trust.

---

## Definition of Failure (Operational)

A Council failure is defined as any event where:
- Harm occurred or nearly occurred
- Drift went undetected or unaddressed
- Governance response lagged behind consequence
- Responsibility boundaries were unclear or violated
- Incentives favored recurrence

Failure is **not** defined by public backlash, reputational damage, or emotional discomfort.

---

## Core Principle

> Failure is a signal of structural mismatch, not moral deficiency.

Postmortems examine **conditions**, not character.

---

## Trigger Conditions

This protocol is initiated when any of the following occur:

- A live incident escalates to SCL/OL-level intervention
- A steward declares repeated unresolved domain stress
- External consequences exceed internal anticipation
- Council decisions produce unintended second-order harm
- Silence, delay, or diffusion of responsibility is detected

Invocation may be initiated by **any steward**.

---

## Postmortem Phases

### Phase 1 — Stabilization (Immediate)

Objective: Prevent compounding harm.

Actions:
- Pause further action in the affected domain
- Secure artifacts, logs, and decision traces
- Confirm no ongoing exposure or amplification

No analysis occurs in this phase.

---

### Phase 2 — Classification (Structural)

Objective: Correctly locate the failure.

Questions addressed:
- Was this a **persona failure** or an **environmental failure**? (OL-1.6)
- Which boundary domains were involved?
- Where did responsibility blur or lapse?
- Which incentives were active at the time?

Misclassification at this stage invalidates all downstream analysis.

---

### Phase 3 — Timeline Reconstruction (Factual)

Objective: Establish a shared reality.

Actions:
- Reconstruct decisions, signals, and handoffs
- Identify when early signals appeared
- Note where escalation *should* have occurred but didn’t

Interpretation is deferred. Facts only.

---

### Phase 4 — Structural Diagnosis

Objective: Identify *why* the system behaved as it did.

Analysis focuses on:
- Incentive misalignment
- Capability introduced without metabolization
- Steward overload or role ambiguity
- Missing containment mechanisms
- Drift normalization

Language of blame is explicitly prohibited.

---

### Phase 5 — Correction Design

Objective: Prevent recurrence.

Outputs may include:
- Incentive redesign
- Boundary reinforcement
- Steward reassignment or rotation (OL-1.8)
- New preventive principles (OL-1.5)
- Required metabolization cycles (OL-1.3 / OL-1.5)

Corrections must be **structural**, not admonitory.

---

### Phase 6 — Integration & Closure

Objective: Return coherence to the system.

Actions:
- Document learnings
- Update relevant OL protocols
- Record case (anonymized if necessary) in `cases/`
- Author a brief closure summary

The Scribe confirms closure.

---

## Psychological Safety Clause

Participation in postmortems:
- Does not imply fault
- Does not reduce standing
- Does not create liability narratives

Withholding signal or delaying escalation **does** constitute a governance concern.

---

## Drift Prevention Clause

Repeated similar failures without structural correction are treated as **systemic drift**, not isolated events.

Drift escalates automatically to Council-wide review.

---

## Closing Statement

A Council that cannot examine its failures
will eventually become one.

A Council that **learns structurally**
turns failure into foresight.
