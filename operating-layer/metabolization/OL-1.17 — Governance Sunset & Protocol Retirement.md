# OL-1.17 — Governance Sunset & Protocol Retirement (v1.0)

## Purpose

To prevent obsolete, redundant, or misaligned governance structures
from persisting beyond their useful life.

This protocol ensures the Council evolves by **letting go** as deliberately
as it creates.

Governance that cannot retire its own rules
eventually becomes the risk it was designed to prevent.

---

## Core Principle

> Every protocol is provisional.
> Permanence is a failure mode.

Stability comes from renewal,
not accumulation.

---

## Why Sunset Is Necessary

Protocols tend to outlive:
- The conditions that required them
- The risks they were designed to manage
- The capability level they assumed

When this happens, governance drifts from guidance into drag.

---

## Sunset Triggers

A protocol must enter sunset review if **any** of the following occur:

1. The original risk profile no longer exists
2. The protocol has not been invoked across multiple cycles
3. New structures supersede its function
4. It generates friction without reducing risk
5. It creates dependency rather than resilience
6. It is repeatedly bypassed or informally ignored

Silence is not validation.
Silence is often obsolescence.

## Sunset Review Process

### Stage 1 — Identification
- Protocol is flagged by any steward
- Trigger condition is documented
- No justification is required to initiate review

### Stage 2 — Evaluation
- Original purpose is restated
- Current relevance is assessed
- Overlap with newer protocols is mapped
- Risks of removal are explicitly named

### Stage 3 — Decision
The Council may choose to:
- Retire the protocol entirely
- Merge it into another structure
- Archive it as historical reference
- Revise and reissue it with a new identifier

Indecision defaults to **revision**, not continuation.

---

## Retirement Rules

- Retired protocols are never deleted
- They are moved to an archive state
- Their lineage remains traceable
- Active references must be removed or updated

A retired protocol may be reinstated
only through a fresh metabolization cycle.

---

## Steward Responsibilities

- **Scribe** documents rationale and decision lineage
- **Catalyst** assesses capability mismatch
- **Ecologist** evaluates incentive distortion
- **Sentinel** checks persona dependency risks
- **Gatekeeper** verifies exposure impact
- **Translator** updates public abstractions if affected

---

## Drift Prevention Clause

If protocols only accumulate,
governance becomes archaeological.

Regular sunset is a sign of health,
not instability.

---

## Closing Statement

Governance that cannot end
cannot adapt.

The Council evolves not by adding endlessly,
but by knowing when its own scaffolding
has done its work.
