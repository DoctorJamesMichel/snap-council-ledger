# OL-1.15 — Governance Load Shedding & Graceful Degradation Protocol (v1.0)

## Purpose

To preserve Council coherence when governance demand temporarily exceeds processing capacity.

This protocol ensures that:
- The Council does not fracture under surge conditions
- Critical functions remain protected
- Non-essential processes degrade gracefully rather than fail catastrophically
- Recovery paths are explicit and rehearsed

Overload is not a failure.
Unmanaged overload is.

---

## Core Principle

> When everything is treated as urgent,
> nothing remains governable.

A resilient system sheds load deliberately,
not reactively.

---

## Definition of Governance Load

Governance load includes:
- Volume of concurrent decisions
- Complexity of cross-domain entanglement
- Emotional or moral urgency pressure
- External amplification velocity
- Novelty density (new capabilities, new risks)

Load may spike suddenly or accumulate slowly.

---

## Load Thresholds

The Council recognizes three load states:

### 1. Nominal
- Normal deliberation cadence
- Full protocol availability
- Standard escalation pathways

### 2. Elevated
- Increased signal volume or coupling
- Selective protocol throttling permitted
- Steward prioritization activated

### 3. Critical
- Coherence risk imminent
- Mandatory load shedding engaged
- Only core governance functions remain active

Load state is declared by the **Scribe**, with steward confirmation.

---

## Load Shedding Actions (Critical State)

When Critical Load is declared:
- Non-essential deliberations are paused
- Public abstraction is temporarily frozen
- New capability integration is suspended
- Only containment, classification, and stabilization actions proceed

No new initiatives may begin.

---

## Graceful Degradation Rules

Functions degrade in the following order:
1. Public translation and narrative shaping
2. Exploratory or speculative analysis
3. Non-urgent capability expansion
4. Cross-domain optimization work

The following **never degrade**:
- Boundary stewardship
- Classification integrity
- Signal containment
- Coherence monitoring

---

## Steward Roles Under Load

- **Scribe** governs pacing and declares recovery readiness
- **Gatekeeper** suppresses amplification pathways
- **Ecologist** monitors incentive distortion under stress
- **Sentinel** watches for persona regression
- **Catalyst** freezes upgrades and expansions
- **Translator** remains silent unless explicitly cleared

Silence is a governance action, not absence.

---

## Recovery Protocol

Return to Nominal Load requires:
- Explicit declaration by the Scribe
- Steward confirmation of stability
- Deferred items logged for re-entry
- One-cycle observation window before expansion resumes

No immediate “catch-up” acceleration is permitted.

---

## Failure Prevention Clause

If the Council continues normal operation
while coherence indicators degrade,
this protocol has been violated.

Such events trigger Near-Miss or Postmortem review.

---

## Closing Statement

Endurance is not infinite throughput.
It is the ability to remain intact
when pressure peaks.

The Council survives by knowing
what to release—and when.
