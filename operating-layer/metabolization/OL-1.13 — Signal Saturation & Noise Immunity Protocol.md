# OL-1.13 — Signal Saturation & Noise Immunity Protocol (v1.0)

## Purpose

To protect the SNAP Council from **over-sensitivity, signal inflation, and interpretive fatigue**
once Silent Signal Escalation (OL-1.12) is active.

This protocol ensures that:
- Early warning does not become chronic alarm
- Attention remains finite and intentional
- Governance retains discrimination, not paranoia
- Signal listening strengthens coherence rather than eroding it

Healthy sensing requires **immunity as well as receptivity**.

---

## Core Principle

> Not every signal deserves equal weight.
> But every signal deserves a place to land.

Noise is not the presence of many signals.
Noise is the **loss of discrimination**.

---

## Definition of Signal Saturation

Signal saturation occurs when:
- Volume increases faster than integration capacity
- Stewards feel compelled to react rather than observe
- Pattern recognition degrades into vigilance
- Signals begin competing for attention rather than clustering

Saturation is a **structural condition**, not a failure of discipline.

---

## Noise vs Signal Distinction

### Noise Characteristics
- High emotional charge, low recurrence
- Novelty without pattern continuity
- Demand for immediate action
- Resistance to quiet holding

### Signal Characteristics
- Repetition across time or domains
- Escalation without urgency
- Persistence despite low visibility
- Compatibility with delayed interpretation

The Council responds only to **signal**, never to pressure.

---

## Saturation Threshold Indicators

The following indicate approaching saturation:
- Increased steward fatigue or irritability
- Compression of review cycles
- Premature classification attempts
- Moral framing replacing structural analysis

Any steward may declare **Saturation Watch**.

---

## Saturation Watch Protocol

When Saturation Watch is declared:

1. **Intake slows**
   - New signals are logged but not reviewed immediately
2. **Pattern windows widen**
   - Longer temporal frames are used
3. **Interpretation pauses**
   - No new classifications are issued
4. **Steward load is redistributed**
   - Attention is rebalanced across domains

No corrective action occurs during watch.

---

## Noise Shedding Mechanisms

The Council may deliberately:
- Archive signals without escalation
- Allow signals to expire unacted upon
- Collapse similar signals into a single trace
- Designate signal dormancy periods

Dormancy is not dismissal.
It is conservation of clarity.

---

## Immunity Clause

A Council that attempts to process everything
loses the ability to process anything well.

Therefore:
- Silence is allowed
- Inaction is sometimes optimal
- Waiting is considered an active governance stance

---

## Relationship to Other Protocols

- Works in tandem with Silent Signal Escalation (OL-1.12)
- Precedes Near-Miss Analysis (OL-1.11)
- Informs Preventive Boundary Design (OL-1.5)
- Respects Role Inserts and steward authority (OL-1.7)

This protocol guards the **quality of attention**.

---

## Drift Prevention Clause

If signal volume rises while discrimination falls,
the system is drifting toward reactivity.

Such drift requires Council reflection,
not acceleration.

---

## Closing Statement

Sensitivity without immunity is fragility.

The Council listens carefully—
and knows when to rest its ears.
