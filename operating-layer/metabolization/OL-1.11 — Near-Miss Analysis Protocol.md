# OL-1.11 — Near-Miss Analysis Protocol (v1.0)

## Purpose

To capture and metabolize **near-miss events**—instances where harm *almost* occurred but was avoided—so that:
- Latent structural risks are detected early
- Learning occurs without waiting for failure
- Preventive corrections are made quietly and efficiently
- Council intelligence increases without public consequence

This protocol exists because **most failures announce themselves before they arrive**.

---

## Definition of a Near-Miss

A near-miss is any event in which:
- A harmful outcome was plausible
- Protective mechanisms intervened by chance, timing, or individual action
- Structural safeguards were insufficient but not fully breached
- The system “got lucky”

Near-misses are treated as **real failures deferred**, not successes.

---

## Core Principle

> What nearly failed once will fail later—unless corrected.

Luck is not a safeguard.

---

## Trigger Conditions

This protocol is initiated when any steward observes:

- An intervention that narrowly prevented harm
- A decision that succeeded despite weak structure
- A containment mechanism that worked only because of timing or individual judgment
- Repeated strain in a boundary domain without incident (yet)
- A postmortem (OL-1.10) revealing earlier ignored signals

Invocation does **not** require Council-wide concern.

---

## Near-Miss Analysis Phases

### Phase 1 — Signal Capture (Immediate)

Objective: Preserve ephemeral insight.

Actions:
- Briefly record what *almost* happened
- Identify the moment the risk became visible
- Note who intervened and how

This phase is intentionally lightweight.

---

### Phase 2 — Structural Classification

Objective: Locate the vulnerability.

Questions addressed:
- Persona vs environment? (OL-1.6)
- Which boundary domain was stressed?
- Was the intervention designed—or improvised?
- Would this have repeated under slightly different conditions?

If classification is unclear, escalate for clarification.

---

### Phase 3 — Luck Assessment

Objective: Determine reliance on chance.

Analysis focuses on:
- Timing dependencies
- Individual heroics
- Informal knowledge not encoded in structure
- Missing guardrails

Any reliance on luck is treated as **unacceptable risk**.

---

### Phase 4 — Preventive Design Review

Objective: Close the gap quietly.

Outputs may include:
- Incentive adjustment
- Boundary reinforcement
- Automation or default redesign
- Steward reassignment or load balancing
- Addition to preventive principles (OL-1.5)

Changes are sized proportionally to risk—not dramatized.

---

### Phase 5 — Minimal Documentation

Objective: Preserve learning without noise.

Actions:
- Record the near-miss in a short internal note
- Optionally add an anonymized entry to `cases/`
- Cross-link to relevant OL protocols

No public narrative is generated.

---

## Relationship to Failure Postmortems

- Near-miss analysis is **preferred** to postmortems
- Multiple near-misses without correction escalate to OL-1.10
- Failure without prior near-miss analysis indicates signal blindness

---

## Psychological Safety Clause

Reporting a near-miss:
- Is considered a governance contribution
- Does not imply incompetence
- Is never penalized

Failure to report repeated near-misses **is** a governance concern.

---

## Drift Early-Warning Clause

Clusters of near-misses in the same domain indicate:
- Incentive misalignment
- Steward overload
- Boundary erosion

Such clusters automatically trigger Council review.

---

## Closing Statement

Mature governance does not wait for proof.
It listens for whispers.

A Council that learns from near-misses
rarely needs to explain its failures.
