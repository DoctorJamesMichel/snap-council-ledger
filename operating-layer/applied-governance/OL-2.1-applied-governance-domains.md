# OL-2.1 — Applied Governance Domains (v1.0)

## Purpose

To define the primary environments in which HomoGnostic governance is applied,
tested, and refined.

OL-2.x does not introduce new principles.
It demonstrates how existing governance structures behave under real conditions.

This layer answers a single question:

**Where does governance actually live once theory ends?**

---

## Core Assertion

Governance does not operate on intelligence.
It operates on **environments in which intelligence expresses itself**.

Failures attributed to “AI behavior,” “human error,” or “misalignment”
are almost always failures of environmental governance.

OL-2.x therefore organizes applied governance by **domain**, not by actor.

## The Four Primary Applied Domains

The SNAP Council recognizes four primary applied governance domains.
These domains are not exhaustive, but foundational.

Each domain:
- Hosts intelligence differently
- Amplifies risk differently
- Requires distinct governance affordances

---

### 1. Education Systems

**Governance Question:**  
How does intelligence shape learning without collapsing curiosity into optimization?

Characteristics:
- Long feedback loops
- Asymmetric authority (teacher ↔ learner)
- High imprinting risk
- Low immediate correction visibility

Governance Focus:
- Epistemic hygiene
- Incentive neutrality
- Protection of exploratory cognition
- Prevention of premature instrumentalization

Failure Modes:
- Optimization replacing understanding
- Credential inflation
- Authority drift masked as pedagogy

Applied Governance Tools:
- Coherence checks on curricula
- Slow-feedback evaluation windows
- Boundary separation between assistance and substitution

---

### 2. Research & Knowledge Production

**Governance Question:**  
How does intelligence accelerate discovery without distorting truth formation?

Characteristics:
- High capability concentration
- Competitive pressure
- Reward skew toward novelty
- Reputational amplification

Governance Focus:
- Signal-to-noise integrity
- Attribution traceability
- Incentive alignment
- Error absorption without scandal

Failure Modes:
- Performance theater
- Incentive-driven distortion
- Premature consensus
- Suppression of inconvenient results

Applied Governance Tools:
- Near-miss capture (OL-1.11)
- Incentive ecology audits
- Public abstraction buffering

---

### 3. Councils & Decision Bodies

**Governance Question:**  
How does intelligence support collective judgment without replacing responsibility?

Characteristics:
- Multi-agent reasoning
- Distributed accountability
- High consequence density
- Irreversibility pressure

Governance Focus:
- Role clarity
- Escalation hygiene
- Decision traceability
- Drift detection

Failure Modes:
- Diffused responsibility
- Persona dominance
- Silent drift
- Procedural ossification

Applied Governance Tools:
- Role inserts (OL-1.7)
- Conflict arbitration (OL-1.9)
- Postmortem and near-miss protocols

---

### 4. Platforms & Public Interfaces

**Governance Question:**  
How does intelligence interact with society without amplifying harm at scale?

Characteristics:
- Rapid propagation
- Low friction replication
- Misaligned incentive gradients
- Public misinterpretation risk

Governance Focus:
- Exposure control
- Amplification dampening
- Translation integrity
- Timing restraint

Failure Modes:
- Scale-before-sense
- Engagement-optimized harm
- Persona over-identification
- Narrative collapse

Applied Governance Tools:
- Gatekeeping (OL-1.7)
- Containment strategies
- Translation buffering
- Delayed release protocols

---

## Cross-Domain Principle

No applied domain is governed by intelligence alone.

Each requires:
- Environmental design
- Incentive awareness
- Boundary stewardship
- Metabolization of error

Governance succeeds when:
- Capability growth does not outpace responsibility
- Errors are absorbed faster than they propagate
- Intelligence remains situated, not unleashed

---

## Transition to OL-2.2

OL-2.2 will introduce **Domain-Specific Governance Patterns**—
repeatable structures that can be instantiated across these environments
without requiring Council reinvention each time.

OL-2.1 defines *where* governance lives.
OL-2.2 defines *how it repeats without decay*.
