# OL-2.7 — Failure Propagation Maps (v1.0)

## Purpose
To make visible how localized failures propagate across domains, roles, and time
so that intervention occurs **before systemic damage**.

This protocol replaces post-hoc blame with **predictive containment**.

---

## Core Principle

Failures do not spread randomly.
They follow **recognizable propagation paths** shaped by incentives, exposure, and delay.

Mapping those paths converts surprise into foresight.

---

## Failure Propagation Axes

All failures propagate along one or more of the following axes:

1. **Temporal Delay**
   - Small failure ignored → amplified downstream
2. **Exposure Gradient**
   - Local error → platform amplification → reputational damage
3. **Incentive Reinforcement**
   - Rewarded behavior → repeated harm
4. **Role Diffusion**
   - Unclear ownership → inaction
5. **Narrative Drift**
   - Explanation precedes structure → loss of coherence

Each axis compounds the others.

## Canonical Propagation Patterns

### Pattern A — Local → Global
- Origin: Persona or tool misuse
- Vector: Exposure & amplification
- Result: System-level trust erosion

### Pattern B — Capability → Incentive
- Origin: New capability introduced
- Vector: Misaligned rewards
- Result: Normalized misuse

### Pattern C — Silence → Drift
- Origin: Near-miss unlogged
- Vector: Time
- Result: Repeated failure framed as anomaly

---

## Mapping Protocol

When a failure or near-miss is logged:

1. Identify origin domain
2. Trace propagation axes activated
3. Project next two likely downstream effects
4. Assign containment steward
5. Log map for pattern learning

Maps are **living documents**, updated as new data arrives.

---

## Intervention Thresholds

- **Single-axis propagation:** Steward action
- **Two-axis propagation:** Cross-domain coordination
- **Three or more axes:** Council intervention mandatory

---

## Closing Statement

We do not prevent failure by reacting faster.
We prevent it by **seeing how it moves**.

Failure propagation maps turn governance
from response into anticipation.
