# OL-2.4 — Council Deliberation Domain Pattern (v1.0)

## Domain Name
Council Deliberation

---

## Primary Function
Enable collective sense-making and decision coherence under conditions of uncertainty, novelty, and scale.

Deliberation exists to **clarify**, not to win.

---

## Primary Risk Vector
Consensus pressure replacing truth sensitivity.

When agreement becomes the goal, coherence dissolves.

---

## Failure Mode Classification

- **Persona-Level Risk:** Dominance, performative certainty
- **Environment-Level Risk:** Time pressure, reputational stakes
- **Exposure-Level Risk:** Public visibility shaping internal judgment

Most deliberative failure arises from exposure mismatch.

---

## Boundary Conditions

- No decision without classification
- No vote without articulated dissent space
- No urgency without explicit justification

Speed is not clarity.

---

## Feedback Signals

- Convergence without exploration
- Silence following strong assertions
- Repeated framing without reframing
- Decisions defended before understood

---

## Correction Path

- Pause deliberation
- Reopen classification under OL-1.6
- Invite reframing from non-dominant perspectives

Correction restores signal diversity.

---

## Escalation Trigger

- Repeated decisions followed by revision
- Authority invoked without structural basis
- Drift between stated values and outcomes

Escalation preserves deliberative integrity.

---

## Closing Note

A Council governs best when disagreement is metabolized,
not suppressed.

Deliberation is a coherence engine, not a consensus machine.
