# OL-2.5 — Human–AI Collaboration Domain Pattern (v1.0)

## Domain Name
Human–AI Collaboration

---

## Primary Function
Enable shared intelligence environments where human judgment, responsibility, and context remain intact while AI extends capability.

Collaboration exists to **augment sense-making**, not replace agency.

---

## Primary Risk Vector
Delegation without responsibility traceability.

When AI outputs are accepted without ownership, governance collapses.

---

## Failure Mode Classification

- **Persona-Level Risk:** Anthropomorphism, misplaced trust
- **Environment-Level Risk:** Incentives favoring speed over review
- **Exposure-Level Risk:** Scale amplifying unexamined outputs

Failures are almost always structural.

---

## Boundary Conditions

- No output without human attribution
- No autonomy without review loops
- No scaling without prior metabolization

Responsibility must remain locatable.

---

## Feedback Signals

- Deference replacing judgment
- Outputs accepted faster than reviewed
- Difficulty explaining decisions post hoc
- Silence where questions should arise

---

## Correction Path

- Reassert human decision ownership
- Introduce friction intentionally
- Downgrade autonomy temporarily

Correction restores agency, not control.

---

## Escalation Trigger

- Repeated acceptance of unreviewed outputs
- Ambiguity over who decided what
- Public impact without internal understanding

Triggers demand Council attention.

---

## Closing Note

AI does not remove responsibility.
It **concentrates** it.

Collaboration succeeds only when agency remains explicit.
