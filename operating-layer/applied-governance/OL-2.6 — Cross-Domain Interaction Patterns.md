# OL-2.6 — Cross-Domain Interaction Patterns (v1.0)

## Purpose
To define how governance domains interact without collapsing into:
- Role confusion
- Authority leakage
- Redundant intervention
- Hidden coupling failures

This protocol ensures that **domain patterns remain distinct while interoperable**.

---

## Core Principle

Failures rarely originate within a single domain.
They emerge at **domain boundaries**.

Cross-domain governance exists to:
- Detect boundary strain early
- Route signals to the correct steward
- Prevent corrective overreach

---

## Recognized Interaction Types

The Council recognizes four primary cross-domain interaction patterns.

### 1. Cascade Interaction
**Definition:**  
A change or failure in one domain propagates into others over time.

**Example:**
- Human–AI Collaboration failure → Educational distortion → Governance drift

**Handling Rule:**
- Initial steward retains responsibility
- Downstream stewards observe and report
- Escalation occurs only if propagation accelerates

---

### 2. Feedback Loop Interaction
**Definition:**  
Two or more domains reinforce each other cyclically.

**Example:**
- Education incentives shaping AI use
- AI outputs reshaping educational norms

**Handling Rule:**
- Ecologist initiates loop analysis
- Scribe synthesizes cross-domain impact
- Council intervenes at the incentive level first

---

### 3. Tension Interaction
**Definition:**  
Domains pull in opposing directions without clear failure.

**Example:**
- Governance deliberation slowing deployment
- Collaboration domain pushing capability rollout

**Handling Rule:**
- No forced resolution
- Tension is treated as signal, not defect
- Decision deferred until classification stabilizes

---

### 4. Collision Interaction
**Definition:**  
Direct conflict between domain rules or outputs.

**Example:**
- Educational openness vs. exposure containment
- Transparency vs. safety constraints

**Handling Rule:**
- Immediate pause
- Invoke OL-1.6 classification
- Arbitration proceeds under OL-1.9

---

## Interaction Detection Signals

Cross-domain strain is indicated by:
- Repeated rework without clarity
- Multiple stewards intervening simultaneously
- Decisions that “feel correct” but degrade coherence
- Responsibility becoming diffuse or ambiguous

Detection is more important than attribution.

---

## Routing Protocol

When cross-domain interaction is detected:

1. Identify **primary originating domain**
2. Identify **affected secondary domains**
3. Assign **single coordinating steward**
4. Log interaction for pattern tracking
5. Escalate only if coherence degrades

No domain may unilaterally resolve cross-domain issues.

---

## Prohibited Behaviors

- Silent boundary crossing
- Fixing downstream symptoms only
- Reframing conflicts as personal disagreement
- Speed-based overrides

These accelerate drift.

---

## Periodic Review

Cross-domain interactions are reviewed:
- During metabolization cycles (OL-1.x)
- During near-miss analysis (OL-1.11)
- Before scaling or public deployment

Patterns, not incidents, are evaluated.

---

## Closing Statement

Healthy governance is not frictionless.
It is **well-articulated at the seams**.

Cross-domain interaction patterns ensure that complexity
produces coherence rather than collapse.
