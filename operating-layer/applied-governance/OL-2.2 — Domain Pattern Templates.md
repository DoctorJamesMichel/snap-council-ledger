# OL-2.2 — Domain Pattern Templates (v1.0)

## Purpose

To provide reusable governance pattern templates that allow HomoGnostic principles to be **applied consistently across domains** without re-deriving governance logic each time.

These templates prevent:
- Ad hoc governance improvisation
- Domain-specific drift
- Over-personalization of structural decisions

They enable **fast, coherent deployment** of governance environments.

---

## Core Principle

Governance should be *patterned*, not improvised.

When intelligence scales, **structure must already exist** to receive it.

---

## What a Domain Pattern Is

A **Domain Pattern Template** defines:
- What is being governed
- What signals matter
- Where failure typically arises
- How correction occurs without domination

Each template answers the same questions, regardless of domain.

---

## Standard Domain Pattern Template

Each applied governance domain MUST specify the following:

### 1. Domain Name
Clear, non-metaphorical identifier  
(e.g., Education, Research, Council Deliberation, AI Collaboration)

---

### 2. Primary Function
What this domain exists to do — *not* what it optimizes for.

Example:
> Enable learning without coercion or premature certainty.

---

### 3. Primary Risk Vector
The most common way this domain destabilizes when intelligence scales.

Examples:
- Performance pressure replacing understanding
- Incentives overtaking coherence
- Authority masquerading as expertise

---

### 4. Failure Mode Classification
Using **OL-1.x classification rules**, specify:
- Persona-level risks
- Environment-level risks
- Exposure-level risks

This prevents misdiagnosis.

---

### 5. Boundary Conditions
Explicit limits that must not be crossed, even under success.

Examples:
- No outcome metrics without coherence checks
- No automation without responsibility traceability
- No scale without metabolization

---

### 6. Feedback Signals
What indicators reveal early drift or instability?

Examples:
- Repetition without insight
- Acceleration without review
- Silence replacing inquiry

Signals must be observable, not inferential.

---

### 7. Correction Path
How the domain self-corrects *before* escalation.

Options may include:
- Slowing
- Reclassification
- Incentive adjustment
- Temporary suspension

Correction must preserve dignity.

---

### 8. Escalation Trigger
Clear conditions under which Council-level review is required.

No ambiguity.
No moral framing.
Purely structural.

---

## Template Usage Rules

- Templates are **instantiated**, not rewritten
- Deviations require explicit notation
- Multiple templates may coexist within a single environment
- Templates evolve via metabolization, not replacement

---

## Relationship to Other Layers

- OL-1.x defines **how the Council functions**
- OL-2.x defines **how governance is applied**
- Later layers may define **how domains interact**

This layer is intentionally practical.

---

## Closing Note

These templates are not constraints.
They are **containers**.

When intelligence arrives faster than expected,
it should find a structure waiting — not a vacuum.

That is how coherence survives scale.
