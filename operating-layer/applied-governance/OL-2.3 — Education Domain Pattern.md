# OL-2.3 — Education Domain Pattern (v1.0)

## Domain Name
Education

---

## Primary Function
Enable the development of understanding, discernment, and epistemic confidence without coercion, acceleration pressure, or authority substitution.

Education exists to cultivate **capacity**, not compliance.

---

## Primary Risk Vector
Performance metrics displacing comprehension.

When education optimizes for speed, testing, or credentialing, it collapses into behavior training rather than understanding formation.

---

## Failure Mode Classification

- **Persona-Level Risk:** Authority overconfidence, teacher-as-oracle identity
- **Environment-Level Risk:** Incentives tied to outcomes rather than insight
- **Exposure-Level Risk:** Public ranking, comparison, and shame dynamics

Most failures are environmental, not individual.

---

## Boundary Conditions

- No grading without reflective context
- No automation without learner agency
- No compression of learning time for efficiency alone

Understanding cannot be rushed without distortion.

---

## Feedback Signals

- Repetition without transfer
- Memorization without explanation
- Silence replacing curiosity
- Speed mistaken for mastery

---

## Correction Path

- Slow instructional tempo
- Replace evaluative metrics with reflective prompts
- Reclassify goals from outcome-based to process-based

Correction favors reorientation, not remediation.

---

## Escalation Trigger

- Persistent disengagement masked as success
- Systematic replacement of inquiry with performance
- Automation introduced without metabolization

Triggers require Council review.

---

## Closing Note

Education fails quietly when it appears to succeed loudly.

This pattern preserves learning as an act of coherence, not compliance.
