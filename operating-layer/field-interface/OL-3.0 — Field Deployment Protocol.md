# OL-3.0 — Field Deployment Protocol (v1.0)

## Purpose
To govern how Council-approved patterns move from ledger
into **real-world application** without distortion, overreach, or premature scale.

---

## Core Principle

Nothing is “ready” simply because it is coherent.
Readiness is demonstrated through **controlled exposure**.

---

## Deployment Stages

### Stage 1 — Contained Trial
- Limited scope
- Named steward
- Explicit success and failure signals
- No public amplification

### Stage 2 — Observed Expansion
- Broader participation
- Feedback channels active
- Near-miss logging mandatory

### Stage 3 — Public Interface
- Translator engaged
- Narrative abstraction approved
- Exposure throttles in place

No stage may be skipped.

---

## Readiness Criteria

Before advancing stages, confirm:
- Clear domain ownership
- Known failure propagation paths (OL-2.7)
- Metabolization plan for new capabilities
- Exit conditions defined

---

## Abort & Pause Authority

Any steward may:
- Pause deployment if coherence degrades
- Trigger OL-1.x metabolization
- Request reclassification

Pause is not failure.
Pause is governance functioning.

---

## Closing Statement

Deployment is not execution.
It is **listening at scale**.

Field deployment succeeds when learning
outpaces consequence.
