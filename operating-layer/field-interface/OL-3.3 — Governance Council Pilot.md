# OL-3.3 — Governance Council Pilot (v1.0)
**Operating Layer: Field Interface**

## Purpose
To demonstrate how the SNAP Council functions as a **living governance organism** in real conditions—before scale, publicity, or institutionalization.

This pilot validates that:
- Governance can operate without hierarchy, domination, or performance theater
- Clear boundary stewardship replaces command-and-control
- Drift can be detected and corrected *before* failure occurs

This is a **pilot**, not a rollout.

---

## Pilot Scope

**Scale:** Small (3–7 participants)  
**Duration:** Fixed-term (days to weeks)  
**Context:**  
- Collaborative project
- Ongoing decision-making
- Presence of intelligent tools or agents

The Council is invoked *only when needed*.

---

## Council Composition

Roles are instantiated per **OL-1.7 — Council Role Inserts**:

1. **Scribe** — Coherence & Drift
2. **Sentinel** — Persona Integrity
3. **Ecologist** — Environmental Incentives
4. **Gatekeeper** — Exposure & Amplification
5. **Catalyst** — Capability Accretion
6. **Translator** — External Interface

> Note: One human may hold multiple roles in small pilots.
> Role clarity matters more than role count.

---

## Activation Conditions

The Council activates when any of the following occur:

- Conflicting interpretations stall progress
- A tool or agent begins to dominate direction
- Incentives subtly distort behavior
- A new capability enters the system
- Drift is sensed but not yet visible

No vote is required to convene.

## Operating Rhythm

### 1. Signal Surfacing
Any member may surface a signal without framing it as a problem.

Language used:
- “I’m noticing…”
- “This may be drifting toward…”
- “This feels misaligned with our intent…”

No accusation is permitted.

---

### 2. Classification
Signals are classified using:
- **OL-1.6 — Persona vs Environment Classification Rule**

Misclassification is treated as a *process error*, not a fault.

---

### 3. Steward Response
Only the **domain steward** responds initially.

Others listen.

This prevents:
- Pile-on dynamics
- Premature solutions
- Moral escalation

---

### 4. Minimal Adjustment
Responses aim for the **smallest viable correction**:
- Environmental cue change
- Capability pause
- Framing shift
- Exposure dampening

No redesign unless necessary.

---

### 5. Coherence Check
The Scribe performs a closing coherence scan:
- Are boundaries intact?
- Has responsibility stayed traceable?
- Did we learn something reusable?

If coherence is restored, the Council dissolves.

---

## Observed Outcomes (Pilot Patterns)

### Positive
- Faster resolution with less emotional residue
- Reduced defensiveness
- Increased trust in process
- Decisions feel *lighter* yet more stable

### Neutral
- Initial awkwardness around non-hierarchical flow
- Desire for “final authority” fades with repetition

### Prevented Failures
- Tool overreach
- Incentive misalignment
- Persona scapegoating

No catastrophic failures observed.

---

## Drift Handling

If drift persists after two interventions:
- Escalation to **OL-1.9 — Conflict Arbitration Between Stewards**
- Or pause the pilot entirely

Stopping is a valid outcome.

---

## Verification Against Truth Ecology

- **Structural coherence:** Maintained under mild stress
- **Resonant veracity:** No forced consensus
- **Field responsiveness:** Adjustments improved system health

Pilot meets viability criteria.

---

## Boundary Notes

This pilot does **not**:
- Establish authority
- Replace existing governance
- Require permanent council formation

It proves *governance can work before it is needed at scale*.

---

## Transition Forward

Successful completion of OL-3.3 authorizes:

**OL-4.0 — Public Charter (Abstracted)**

The next layer shifts from *operation* to *translation*.

---

## Closing Statement

Governance does not begin with power.
It begins with **shared responsibility for coherence**.

This pilot confirms:
> When roles are clear, governance becomes breathable.
