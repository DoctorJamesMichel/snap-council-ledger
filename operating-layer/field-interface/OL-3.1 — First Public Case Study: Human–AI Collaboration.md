# OL-3.1 — First Public Case Study: Human–AI Collaboration (v1.0)

## Purpose
To demonstrate applied HomoGnostic governance
through a **real, legible, non-spectacular example**.

This case is educational, not promotional.

---

## Case Selection Rationale

Human–AI collaboration is chosen because:
- It is already ubiquitous
- Failure modes are familiar
- Governance gaps are visible
- Stakes are human-scaled

---

## Case Description (Abstracted)

A collaborative AI system is introduced to assist human decision-making.
Capabilities increase.
Output quality improves.
Unexpected behaviors emerge.

No single error is catastrophic.
The system fails **structurally**, not technically.

---

## Governance Application

Applied layers:
- Domain patterns (OL-2.3 / 2.5)
- Interaction mapping (OL-2.6)
- Failure propagation mapping (OL-2.7)

Interventions focus on:
- Incentive realignment
- Exposure containment
- Role clarity

Not content suppression.

---

## Outcome

- System stabilizes without capability loss
- Human agency preserved
- Learning captured
- Trust maintained

No heroics required.

---

## Why This Case Matters

This is not the future.
This is **already happening**.

What differs is governance presence.

---

## Closing Statement

The first public case is not proof of success.
It is proof of **orientation**.

HomoGnosis begins not with transcendence,
but with responsibility made visible.
